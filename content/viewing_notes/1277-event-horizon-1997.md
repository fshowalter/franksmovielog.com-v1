After two years of pandemic avoidance, I returned to the cinema. The Prince Charles welcomed me back with a red carpet.

Okay, so it was for a premier later that evening, but still…

The movie played better a second time. The piercing volume and larger screen made for more immersive atmosphere, while the 35mm projection better masked the optical effects.

It's still frustrating how close it comes to greatness, but it proves a solid B-Movie. Fishburn's expository dialogue still sounds tin eared and Neill's performance still shines.
