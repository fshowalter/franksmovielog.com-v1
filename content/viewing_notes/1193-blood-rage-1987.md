Commentary watch. Moderator Ewan Cant prompts director John Grissmer for insight, but Grissmer responds to most early questions with one-word answers. As the film unfolds, he expands to single sentences. When asked how he achieved a memorable effect, he replies, “With a lot of work.” He regards the picture as a work-for-hire effort, scuttling my hopes he was drawn to the material's doppelgänger plot. John Dalley, who now co-owns the picture, offers little insight, but speaks with enthusiasm. My most interesting take-away: producer Marianne Kanter--who plays a sanitarium doctor--dictated the nudity and violence.
