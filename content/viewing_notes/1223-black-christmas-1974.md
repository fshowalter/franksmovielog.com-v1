Commentary watch. Recorded in 2001 with director Bob Clark. A few minutes in, after describing how the camera's moving on screen, he admonishes his prior comments as “all terribly didactic.” I smiled, won over. He reveals Gilda Radner had Andrea Martin's role, but dropped out for _Saturday Night Live_. This proves the extent of his behind-the-scenes disclosures. Instead, he focuses on the cinematography and the performances on screen. His stern defense of the film's third act didn't change my opinion, but I appreciated how much he believed in it.
