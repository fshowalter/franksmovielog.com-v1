Commentary watch. Screenwriter Roger Ebert proves entertaining and enlightening.

My favorite anecdote shed light on how director Russ Meyer achieved the film's unusual tone. According to Ebert, Meyer convinced the performers they were playing a straight drama. When some expressed concern about the film's comical nature, Meyer assuaged them with earnest discussions about their character's motivations in each scene. I love it.

And Ebert can't find Pam Grier either, leading me to believe she's not present in the final cut.
