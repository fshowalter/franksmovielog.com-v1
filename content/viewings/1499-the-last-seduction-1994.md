The Criterion stream looks sourced from a lower-resolution (possibly telecine?) source, upscaled, then tweaked. Or perhaps the source was fine, but the encoder settings were wrong. Whatever the cause, it underwhelms, exhibiting the same shortcomings as the Code Red Blu-ray, which bore the disclaimer: “Master Provided by ITV”. Shame on you, ITV.
