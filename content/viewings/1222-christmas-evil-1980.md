Commentary watch. Recorded in 2006 with writer/director Lewis Jackson and John Waters. Waters disappoints, coming in unprepared, having not seen the film for several years despite being a huge fan. He often shifts into a passive viewer, laughing at what's on screen instead of commenting. That said, as an independent filmmaker himself, the questions Waters _does_ ask often prove insightful. For his part, Jackson, unprompted, points out several bits I'd never noticed, such as how he had several interior sets painted with green walls to keep a red-green color scheme, and _Home Improvement_ mom Patricia Richardson in a bit part.
