Commentary watch. Daniel Kremer (author of _Sidney J. Furie: Life and Films_) offers less a running analysis and more of a Sidney Furie appreciation audio essay.

It proves insightful, as we learn Furie came into the picture having been fired from <span data-imdb-id="tt0080948">_The Jazz Singer_</span> after quitting <span data-imdb-id="tt0081230">_Night of the Juggler_</span>. He needed this job, and the producers knew it. An early test came when Furie wanted to cast Craig T. Nelson as Barbara Hershey's boyfriend and the producers wanted Alex Rocco. Rocco got the part.

Kremer is enthusiastic in his praise for the director, pointing out the myriad of stylistic choices and non-traditional setups, including Dutch angles, intense close-ups. But Kremer also reveals the film's financing (involving tax deals) required the film shoot over ten weeks—double the usual length.

This diminishes Furie's achievement, as he opted to tinker with technique instead of fixing the bigger problem—the ending. Kremer won't admit it doesn't work--he's too close to his subject--but admits Furie "regretted" it.
