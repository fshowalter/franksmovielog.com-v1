I may have been too hard on this entry. Showing it to a friend who’s never seen it, I found myself entertained. Despite the lackluster finale, I enjoyed the blatant attempts to telegraph the culprit—and his resemblance to Lon Chaney Jr. This, along with the heightened sleaze, made it play as a goofy, near-satire of the slasher genre. If only it had retained the rumored gory kills and excessive nudity left on the cutting room floor.
