**Jack Lemmon's second feature** re-teams him with Judy Holliday. They play a couple who divorce after eight years of marriage then can't help crossing paths. It's lighthearted and predictable, but fun. Seeing a mustachioed Lemmon dance the mambo with comedic gusto while Holliday matches him in vigor proved a highlight. Kim Novak plays a Monroesque ditzy blonde who takes a liking to Lemmon. Bonus points for the script treating Holliday's position as a successful woman as matter-of-fact rather than an anomaly.
