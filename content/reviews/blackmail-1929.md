**Alfred Hitchcock's first sound picture.** A Scotland Yard constable covers for his girlfriend after realizing she's implicated in a murder. The two then fall afoul of a blackmailer. Hitchcock shot this silent then added the sound scenes later and it shows, but his formal mastery is still amazing. Love the rack focus reflection shot in the opening sequence.
