This entry follows <span data-imdb-id="tt0036016">_Hoppy Serves a Writ_</span> in the Hopalong Cassidy series, carrying over much of that film's cast but working from a better script. Boyd's still an odd fit for a western hero, but this entry doesn't see him brawling with men half his age. It also tones down the slapstick. Casting the older Simpson opposite Boyd proves a double boon. He provides a good foil and makes Boyd appear youthful in comparison.

Granted, she begins as an annoying, bull-headed stereotype, but Claudia Drake's character receives a surprising amount of third-act agency. A nice touch for a film of that era.

Robert Mitchum, in his third movie, plays another forgettable goon, albeit one with more lines.
