It’s Thanksgiving in Jacksonville, Florida. Terry’s twin brother--institutionalized since childhood for a brutal hatchet murder--returns to the family’s garden apartment home. This causes Terry--who _actually_ committed the murder--to embark on a killing rampage.

How to rate this? The execution careens between impressive and embarrassing. It reuses the same locations, but they feel authentic. The camera work feels tepid but never amateurish. The violence shocks but the interstitial scenes vacillate between underwritten and awkward. The production design is non-existent, but the practical effects impress. Mark Soper’s dual-role performance transcends the material, while Louise Lasser seems to phone it in over a bad connection.

I can’t argue _Blood Rage_ is a good movie, but I enjoyed it. For Thanksgiving-themed slashers, accept no substitute.
