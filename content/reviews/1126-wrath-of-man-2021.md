Jason Statham plays an enigmatic guard who joins an armored car service only to display uncanny skills while thwarting an attempted robbery. The twisty script features plot holes big enough to drive said armored car through but with Statham leading this combination of heist and revenge flick, they prove easy enough to ignore.

Director Guy Ritchie focuses much of his formal rigor on Los Angeles drone shots, inviting comparisons to Michael Mann's <span data-imdb-id="tt0113277">_Heat_</span>. This highlights the film's biggest weakness. Statham's great, but the script doesn't fashion him a worthy antagonist. There's no Pacino to his De Niro. Or is it the other way round? Regardless, this and the plot holes prove the difference between good and great.
