**Perhaps the first of Ford's early sound pictures that rated his full attention.** After an accidental collision, an American submarine drifts toward the ocean floor. MacKenna plays a disgraced British officer serving under an assumed name on the sinking sub. When the sub's commander succumbs to stress, MacKenna assumes command and reveals his true identity. The lighthearted opening belies the transition to taunt drama. Though the surviving prints are a mix of dialogue and title cards, Ford's confident execution shines through. John Wayne appears as a radio operator on the surface.
