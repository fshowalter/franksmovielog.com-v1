Opera diva Jeanette MacDonald runs roughshod over everyone in her life only to fall for cat-burglar Reginald Denny, who she meets when he burgles her bedroom. Denny, of course, has aspirations of a singing career himself.

Rather than embrace its screwball setup, the film opts for melodrama. An unfortunate choice, as MacDonald and Denny lack chemistry, leaving the film with no emotional stakes. The script trudges through its predictable plot beats, but we don't care. Even Bela Lugosi fails to register in a throwaway part as a theater impresario.
