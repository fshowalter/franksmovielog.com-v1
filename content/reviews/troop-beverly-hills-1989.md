Shelley Long plays a flakey Beverly Hills housewife who volunteers to lead a Girl Scout-like troop. Predictable hijinks ensue. The child actors don't grate and I liked the Los Angeles locations and the Ted McGinley cameo. But the deleted throat-choke scene proved funnier than anything left in the film.
