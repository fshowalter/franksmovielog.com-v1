A lesser Bergman effort sees upper-class Malmsten blinded in a military accident. During his recovery, he inspires lower-class Zetterling to pursue an education. She falls for him, but their class divide proves too large an obstacle. Time passes. Malmsten slides further down the social ladder, while Zetterling ascends. A chance meeting reunites them. You can see where this is going.

<!-- end -->

Malmsten convinces as a blind man, and at her best, Zetterling reminded me of Carole Lombard. Also, the surreal opening marks Bergman's most formal expression to date. But the rote script and convoluted ending (what was Malmsten doing on the train tracks?) render this effort a disappointment.
