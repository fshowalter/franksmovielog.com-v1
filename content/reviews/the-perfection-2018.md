Engaging performances, clever structure, gruesome effects, and arresting visuals mask gaping plot holes ready to surface upon the slightest introspection. But the film proves a masterclass in misdirection, assaulting us with body horror, graphic violence, and suspense, and upending our expectations with time-jumps and surprise reveals.

It's an entertaining ride, but I'm not sure the bonkers execution jives with the central horror. It needed another abstraction. <span data-imdb-id="tt0063522">_Rosemary's Baby_</span> was about women's reproductive rights, but the central horror was a devil baby, allowing the film to ride the line between high-camp and horror. _The Perfection_ is about--well, I won't spoil it, but suffice it to say there's no devil baby-like abstraction. Not a deal-breaker, but it would be easier to forgive the specious plotting if the big horror was also bonkers.
