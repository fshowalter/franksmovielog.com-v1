Bela Lugosi's first talkie. He plays a sharp-dressed police inspector investigating a mysterious murder at a British estate in colonial India. I always assumed a) Lugosi and director Tod Browning first worked together on <span data-imdb-id="tt0021814">Dracula</span> and b) Dracula was Lugosi's first significant talkie. Wrong on both counts. Back to this movie. It's an atmospheric mystery undone by a convoluted ending that reveals a slew of information the audience couldn't have intuited. <span data-snippet>Disappointing, but Lugosi's performance remains strong.</span> The Warner Archive DVD print is watchable.
