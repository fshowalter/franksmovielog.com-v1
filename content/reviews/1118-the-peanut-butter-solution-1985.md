Bizzare story of a boy who gets frightened so bad he loses all his hair, which refuses to grow back. He receives a formula for hair growth the ghosts of two winos, botches the recipie and winds up with hair that won't stop growing, going from bald at wakeup to cousin it by dinner. And I didn't even mention the kidnapping plot and magic paintings. It's the kind of dark fantasy I would have enjoyed as a kid and appreciate as a grown-up. Not a great movie, but one determined not to talk down to its audience. And bonkers enough to make you wonder what you just watched as the end credits roll.
