**Christopher Lee's feature debut.** Also Terence Young's directorial debut. A <span data-imdb-id="tt0032976">_Rebecca_</span> knock-off featuring Eric Portman as a wealthy eccentric who believes Edana Romney to be the reincarnation of an Italian countess he loved in a past life. Lee's bit part comes early and his lone line lacks his resonant baritone.

Top-notch production design and a compelling turn from Portman prove the highlights. But I struggled with Romney as the lead. She co-wrote the script and gives her all, but lacks the innate charisma of a Joan Fontaine. Her chemistry with Portman suffers as a result. And those eyelashes are ridiculous.
