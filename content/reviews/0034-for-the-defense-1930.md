Powell plays a slick defense lawyer named Bill Foster. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.

<!-- end -->

Bill’s seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he’s not the marrying kind. Irene’s also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill’s back. Jack’s a nice-enough guy, but he lacks Bill’s swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along, hoping Bill will change his mind.

Early one morning, Irene’s driving Jack home. They’ve been out all night and Jack’s pie-eyed drunk. Jack gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist. Jack insists Irene flee the scene and takes the rap for the death alone.

Irene persuades Bill to take Jack’s case. She doesn’t tell Bill she was there. Things look bad for Jack. As the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes Irene’s involvement. Soon, Bill must chose between Irene’s reputation and Jack’s liberty. Irene wants to take the stand to exonerate Jack, but Bill won’t let her. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill vowed he would never cross.

As melodramas go, it's not a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol[^1], and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the _Thin Man_ series of films. His chemistry with Francis is good and she doesn’t overact her part.

But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise solid hour and five minutes.

[^1]: Look fast for Gabby Hayes in an uncredited bit-part as a speakeasy waiter.
