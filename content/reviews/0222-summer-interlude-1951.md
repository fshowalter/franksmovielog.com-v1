Maj-Britt Nilsson plays a dancer reflecting on a coming-of-age summer romance with Birger Malmsten twelve years prior. Compelling performances, beautiful cinematography, and a script that embraces the joy of young love without feeling reductive make for a pleasant viewing experience. Had the ending resonated more, I'd have rated this higher.
