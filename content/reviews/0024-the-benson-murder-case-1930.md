Powell's third outing as amateur detective Phil Vance. After the disappointing Green Murder Case, the franchise returns to form with a closed-circle mystery pitting Powell against a notorious bootlegger. The thunder storm during the setup adds a nice gothic touch and the eccentric supporting cast adds the right touch of light comedy. The distance between Philo Vance and Nick Charles is getting smaller with Powell settling into the role.

I'd like to revisit a better print. All the uploads I found seem sourced from the same low-res scan.
