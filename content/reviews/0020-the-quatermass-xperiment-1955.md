Hammer's first plunge into sci-fi horror stars Brian Donlevy as bulldog scientist Quatermass dealing with a rocket ship returned from space whose lone-survivor, played by Richard Wordsworth, may no longer be human. <span data-snippet>Donlevy's commanding presence overcomes his suspect casting as a scientist, and Wordsworth steals the film with his haunting performance.</span> Love director Val Guest's decision to adopt a realistic styleâ€”it helps the film age. He keeps the special effects off-screen as much as possible. When he does show the goods they often deliver, and even when they fall short they're still unsettling. The Kino Lober print looks great.
