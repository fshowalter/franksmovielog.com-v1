Slice-of-life drama follows Eva Henning and Birger Malmsten as a young couple trapped in a dysfunctional marriage traveling by train home from Italy. Both convince in their roles, but I couldn't summon any empathy for their characters. Henning in particular irritated me--a credit to her performance. The film also digresses--via flashbacks and cut-aways--to the couples' former lovers, who prove just as unengaging. The claustrophobic photography contributes to the sense of entrapment. An accomplished telling of a grating story.
