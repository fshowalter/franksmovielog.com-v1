There's wit to spare in Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard's literate horror film deconstruction. It lays bare the genre's tropes in their logic-defying glory. This “loving hate letter” proves self-referential almost to the point of parody, serving up equal parts genuine thrills and acerbic black comedy. That it doubles as a meta trap-movie places it so snug in my wheelhouse, it's as though they wrote it just for me.
