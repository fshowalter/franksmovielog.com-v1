Riots engulf Paris following a conservative candidate's election victory. Tight shots with handheld cameras convey the chaos and urgency. Five young adult French Muslims--Yasmine (who's hiding a pregnancy), her brother Sami, hot-head Alex (Yasmine's former lover), impetuous Tom, and meek Farid--have seized the opportunity to commit a robbery. Sami suffers a gunshot wound during the escape, prompting the group to split. Tom and Farid flee the city with the cash, while Yasmine and Alex drop Sami at a hospital. They plan to rendezvous in the countryside, but the rural inn they choose as a meeting place harbours nasty surprises. **Spoilers follow.**

The premise invites comparisons to <span data-imdb-id="tt0072271">_The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_</span>. A group of young people chances upon the wrong house and find themselves offed one by one in brutal fashion by a deranged extended family. The twist is that the family are white supremacists headed by an aging Nazi.

As a contemporary update transplanted to rural France, it works. Writer-director Xavier Gens leverages some of the same formal techniques Tobe Hooper employed in _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_, including early tight shots of the protagonists, contrasted with wide shots of the desolate landscape to convey a sense of isolation.

Like Hooper, Gens shows a deft touch for atmosphere, crafting scenes set in a claustrophobic mine where the darkness feels heavier than lead, and a muddy pig barn where you can almost smell the manure.

But Gens lacks Hooper's sense of pacing. Consider the aforementioned mine sequence. It climaxes with Tom and Farid squirming through a tunnel so small they're forced to wiggle like worms. Ahead, they see a circle of light and climb toward it, aware something is closing behind them. As Tom crests the opening, a hammer swings down and bludgeons him. Besides a loose allegory for birth, it's a visual reversal of an iconic scene in Hooper's film, wherein a protagonist moves from the bright exterior into the darkened house only to encounter sudden, brutal violence.

But consider how Hooper stages his scene. Hooper's protagonist hesitates. He's not fleeing an unseen assailant, just wary of the strange house. This allows the tension to build, as Hooper cuts between the house's ominous interior and the sunlit doorway. He lets his protagonist pause and consider his options. Then, once he's lingered long enough for us to feel comfortable, his protagonist advances, and the violence hits the viewer like a punch in the gut.

By this point in Gens’ film, Tom and Farid already know their lives are in danger and must keep moving. The hammer blow proves less shocking because Gens primed us to expect violence. Throughout, Gens tries to compensate by being more explicit. Besides the hammer blow, we see tendons severed, a man boiled alive, another bisected by a table saw, and another bled like livestock. Such explicit violence exceeds anything in Hooper’s film, but Gens’ uneven pacing undermines much of its impact.

Hooper also knew when to quit. Gens builds to a similar climax, with Yasmine forced to endure a “family dinner,” but rather than end here, Gens tacks on an additional act wherein Yasmine takes out the entire family.

Not a <span data-imdb-id="tt0072285">_Thriller_</span>-style revenge. Yasmine is a shell-shocked mess, head tittering and covered in blood. Gens proffers scene after scene of her enduring brutal beatings before some contrived plotting saves her. Her lack of agency robs us of visceral thrill in rooting for her, and the repetitive violence only numbs us, rendering this final act a slog.

This added violence also begs the question: what is the film saying? Is the added violence a commentary on the earlier riots in Paris? On news reports, we hear the victorious candidate promising to crack down on crime. Are the literal Nazis meant to compare or contrast the political right? I'm not sure, but I'll assume the less reductive interpretation and consider it a warning that we haven't exterminated such horrors, just driven them to the fringes.

But this interpretation carries its own set of problems, as the youngsters open the film having committed armed robbery, yet when the situation turns grave, they react like children, wanting to go home. Is Gens chastising his characters for their immaturity or empathising with their plight as disenfranchised French Muslims? Again, I'm not sure, but I struggled to achieve any emotional connection with the characters.

And what about the pregnancy? Is it symbolic or just a cheap way to heighten the violence? There's a side plot thread involving the Nazi patriarch wanting Yasmine to join his “family” to bear more children, as one of their other abductees has only birthed deformed offspring they treat as monsters. Said patriarch mutters about her blood not being “pure,” but that proves the extent of the social commentary.

Indeed, the film hints at sociopolitical metaphor throughout, but cannot deliver a resonant thesis. Thus, it’s an exploitation picture, and would do better to ditch these angles and streamline the narrative.

So what to make of _Frontier(s)_? The first three acts work well enough. Gens thrusts us into a plausible alternate reality and guides us through a nightmare scenario. His directorial touches serve the story, but said story hints at depths it may not possess. Worst of all, his sense of pacing and narrative structure rob his story of its visceral impact. Fans of the New French Extremity wave of horror films should enjoy its craftsmanship, nihilistic attitude, and explicit violence, but those looking for a resonance akin to <span data-imdb-id="tt1029234">_Martyrs_</span> or _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ won't find it here.
