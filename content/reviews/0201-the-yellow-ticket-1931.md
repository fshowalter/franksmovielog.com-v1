In Tsarist Russia, a young Jewish woman desparate to see her ailing father acquires a yellow travel pass, allowing her to move freely thorugh the country, but forever branding her as a prostitute.

An odd little movie that can't help but play like an amateur production of a larger epic. The costumes and set decoration are nice, but they can't disguise the Southern California locales hoping to pass for Russia. Everyone's doing a different acccent, none of them Russian. And Lionel Barrymore's character could pass for a younger version of Mr. Potter.

Still, Walsh makes the most of what he has to work with. The big finale, coinciding with the revolution, mixes equal parts drama and chaos that made me wish he'd been afforded widescreen scope and a larger budget.

Borris Karloff has an uncredited minor part as a drunken porter.
