I'm struggling with this review. On the one hand, I liked the story of four outcasts making their way across wild west Utah, pursued by a maniacal outlaw. The plot proved a surprising exploration of immoral versus evil. The cast engages and director Lucio Fulci and his cinematographer exploit the Austrian locales to present a heightened version of the frontier west that's both beautiful and brutal.

And yet, it didn't resonate. Perhaps it's the dated folk-pop soundtrack. Perhaps it's how Rob Zombie seems to have modelled his look after the film's villain. Or perhaps it's how the standard definition stream lends the film a false sense of cheapness. Whatever the cause, the film deserves a high definition rewatch.
