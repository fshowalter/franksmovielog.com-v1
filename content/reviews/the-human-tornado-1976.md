Rudy Ray Moore returns as Dolemite, a fast-talking, kung-fu fighting entertainer. Fleeing a racist Alabama sheriff (J.B. Baron, who struck me as Haley Joel Osment playing Kenny Rogers), Dolemite and crew travel to Los Angeles. There they discover a local mob goon has forced their friend Queen Bee into servitude. Despite the shoddy production (Ernie Hudson sometimes plays one of Moore's entourage, other times it's an obvious stand-in), Moore's charisma and the earnest intent prove endearing.
