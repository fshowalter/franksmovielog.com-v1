**Robert Mitchum's inauspicious debut.** He plays a grunt in an outlaw gang that's fled into Oklahoma, where Texas sheriff Hopalong “Hoppy” Cassidy, played by William Boyd, lacks jurisdiction. Mitchum's part amounts to a single forgettable line.

As the lead, Boyd makes an unlikely western hero. His white hair, soft physique, and eloquent demeanor feel anachronistic. Yet his performance conveys the easy confidence that comes from having played the part in 40-some prior Hopalong movies.

Although it only runs a few minutes over an hour, lots of transition shots and ill-conceived slapstick bits pad the runtime. Compounding matters, persistent scratches mar the print streaming on Amazon.
