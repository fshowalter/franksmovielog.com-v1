Bob Odenkirk plays Hutch, an everyman stuck in suburban hell. His days are the same, his wife has become a stranger, and his son doesn't respect him. An attempted home robbery unleashes years of pent-up frustration, but the fallout sends Hutch on a collision course with the Russian mafia.

Screenwriter Darek Kolstad also wrote <span data-imdb-id="tt2911666">_John Wick_</span>. Like that film, Kolstad doesn't wrestle with the moral or ethical issues of vigilantism and instead embraces the empowerment fantasy with a gleeful streak of dark humor. But this suburban tweak proves superior because Odenkirk delivers the best unexpected everyman since Bruce Willis in <span data-imdb-id="tt0095016">_Die Hard_</span>.

It's a terrific ride. I can't remember having such a visceral adrenaline reaction as when Hutch seals his family in the basement before going to war.
