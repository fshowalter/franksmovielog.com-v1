Powell's second talkie and first leading role. He plays Philo Vance, a dilettante detective who uses “psychology” to solve the locked-room murder of a notorious showgirl.

<!-- end -->

<span data-snippet>Powell's great, delivering an early version of the urbane sleuth he'd perfect in the _Thin Man_ film series.</span> Bonus points for the script's good red herrings and extended poker scene. Look fast for Pat O'Brien[^1] as a desk sergeant. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0019949">The Greene Murder Case</span>.

[^1]: Maybe. I couldn't find a supporting source.
