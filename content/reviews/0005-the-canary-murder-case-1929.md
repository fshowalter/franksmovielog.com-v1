William Powell's first leading role and first talkie sees him playing Philo Vance, an amateur detective who uses psychology to help the inept but well-meaning police force. Powell's a revelation, delivering a stiff but still
enjoyable version the urbane slueth we'd come to know and love. Bonus points for the drawing room mystery script's good red herrings and an extended poker scene. Look fast for (maybe) Pat O'Brien answering the phone as a desk sergeant.
Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0019949">The Greene Murder Case</span>.
