William Powell's first leading role and first talkie. He plays Philo Vance, an amateur detective who uses “psychology” to solve the locked-room murder of a notorious showgirl.


Powell's great, delivering an early version of the urbane sleuth he'd perfect in the _Thin Man_ film series. Bonus points for the script's good red herrings and extended poker scene. Look fast for Pat O'Brien[^5-1] as a desk sergeant. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0019949">The Greene Murder Case</span>.

[^5-1]:Maybe. I couldn't find a supporting source.
