**A muddled sequel that plays like an ultra-gory episode of _Doctor Who_.** The script throws in robots, a talking parasite, another lycanthrope, shape-shifters (that don't shift-shape), and a hockey match finale that has WolfCop playing goalie. The <span data-imdb-id="tt2781516">first film</span>'s strength came from embracing and amplifying cop-movie tropes. This entry feels less focused, like a middle chapter in a bigger sci-fi saga. Not without laughs, but disappointing.
