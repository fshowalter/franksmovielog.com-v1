I tilt forward in my seat. My heels rise. The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I'm holding my breath.

I've seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout in downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.

The film plays as a cops-and-robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit.

De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro's crew with obsessive fervor as his third marriage crumbles around him. They're Hawksian archetypesâ€”professions personified.

But back to the shootout. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload to their tactical movements, every beat feels authentic. I remember the sustained adrenaline rush left me jittery after my first viewing. You don't witness the scene; you _experience_ it.
