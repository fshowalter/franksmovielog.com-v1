**Brian De Palma's first Hitchcockian thriller.** I won't discuss plot and have redacted spoilers.

I loved the <span data-imdb-id="tt0054215">_Psycho_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0047396">_Rear Window_</span>, and <span data-imdb-id="tt0040746">_Rope_</span> influences and the formal execution. The split-screen technique generated terrific suspense.

Margot Kidder shines. The scene where she looks possessed after she ~~redacted~~ shocked me. Granted, after <span data-imdb-id="tt0078346">_Superman_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0071222">_Black Christmas_</span>, her French accent feels forced, but I can get past that.

My problem lies with the (non) ending. It's an exposition-laden cop-out of style over substance. Pretty to look at, but lacking resonance. Better to leave some things unsaid and avoid the lame ~~redacted~~ crutch.
