Everyone looks so young, but _X-Men_ holds up better than I expected.

<!-- end -->

The themes still resonate. In a near-future, an emerging mutant population evokes fear and uncertainty in humanity. Stewart plays Charles Xavier, a powerful telepath who believes mutants and humans can coexist in peace. Opposite him, McKellen plays Erik Lehnsherr, a former friend turned adversary. Lehnsherr--a Holocaust survivor--views humanity as a threat eager to exterminate mutant-kind.

McKellen remains my favorite part of the film. He projects operatic gravitas, delivering his lines with delicious relish while respecting their subtext.

Also helping: the finale's New York skyline, and a shrewd script that introduces multiple characters, juggles several plot threads, and stages some memorable set pieces, all while clocking in under an hour and forty-five minutes.

_X-Men_ wowed me on opening day. It's lost some luster in the two decades since, but it still outshines more recent DC and lesser Marvel offerings.
