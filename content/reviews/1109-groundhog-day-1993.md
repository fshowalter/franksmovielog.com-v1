I remember seeing this in the theaters and coming away feeling burned. The premise--Bill Murray playing a snooty weatherman forced to repeat the titular day over and over in a small Pennsylvania town--seemed ripe for the meld of dark comedy and fantasy that I'd enjoyed in Scrooged. But Groundhog day played as more of a romantic comedy, with Murray spending his days learning to be a better man to woo his producer, played by Andie MacDowell. At least, that's how I saw it.

But a year or so later, it made its way into rotation at the video store. Little by little, viewing by viewing, the wry humor wormed its way into my subconscous and the film's darker side became more apparent. In college, I gave it a proper revisit and came away impressed. Today I consider it a near-great effort constrained by romantic comedy tropes. Murray's deadpan humor matches the film's darker aspects, while MacDowell charms as the requisite love interest. There's a lot to love here, and who knows? A few more watches and it might crack five stars.
