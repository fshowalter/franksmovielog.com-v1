**Disappointing follow-up to <span data-imdb-id="tt0019745">_The Canary Murder Case_</span>** has William Powell reprising his role as dilettante sleuth Philo Vance investigating a wealthy family where the last surviving heir stands to inherit a fortune.

<!-- end -->

Unlike the prior film, which focused on a single murder, this entry piles up bodies at an absurd rate, culminating in a finale that made me laugh out loud. Also not helping: the costumer’s decision to dress Powell in a kimono, a paisley smoking jacket, an oversized white topcoat, and a pair of thick-rimmed Coke bottle glasses [^1]. Fortunately, not all at once. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0020679">_The Benson Murder Case_</span>.

[^1]: Yes, it’s more in keeping with the source novel’s portrayal of Vance as a dandy, but Powell deserved better.
