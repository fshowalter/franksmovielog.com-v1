Set after <span data-imdb-id="tt0376994">_X-Men: The Last Stand_</span>, a bulked-up Wolverine travels to Japan and encounters a shadowy plot involving a dying industrialist. Three movies in one. The best: an engaging story where the titular character confronts his seeming immortality. Less interesting: comic-book antics involving ninjas and giant samurai armor. Shoe-horned-in: ties to the disappointing prior film. Terrific location photography.
