Powell plays Bill Foster, a slick defense lawyer so well-respected in the underworld that when his car's stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.

<!-- end -->

Bill's seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he's not the marrying kind. Irene's also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill's back. Jack's nice enough, but he lacks Bill's swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along, hoping Bill will come around.

Early one morning, Irene's driving Jack home after a late night out. Pie-eyed drunk, Jack gropes at her, causing her to swerve and kill a stranded motorist. Jack insists Irene flee the scene and takes the manslaughter rap alone.

Irene persuades Bill to take Jack's case without revealing her involvement. Things look bad for Jack. Bill soon realizes Irene's role in the accident and must choose between her reputation and Jack's liberty.

As melodramas go, it's not a bad one. Early on, when Bill's riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol[^1], and underworld connections foreshadow Powell's famous turn as Nick Charles in <span data-imdb-id="tt0025878">_The Thin Man_</span>. His chemistry with Francis is good, and she doesn't overact her part.

But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It's an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise solid hour and five minutes.

[^1]: Look fast for Gabby Hayes as a speakeasy waiter.
