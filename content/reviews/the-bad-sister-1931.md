**Bette Davis's debut.** Sidney Fox plays the titular opportunistic sister in an upstanding Ohio family who falls for a con-man played by Humphrey Bogart. Davis plays her long-suffering sister in a forgettable part. Bogie's vulpine in his first heel role, but the predictable plot and flat performances from Fox and lead Conrad Nagel sink this effort.
