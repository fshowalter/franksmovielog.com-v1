Disappointing follow-up to <span data-imdb-id="tt0019745">The Canary Murder Case</span> sees Powell reprise his role as Philo Vance in a disjointed mystery that struggles under the weight of its own plot. In a possible attempt to compensate for most of the story taking place in a single house, the film hurries Powell one room to another, never allowing him to settle in and shine. Not helping: the costumer's decisions to dress Powell in a kimono, a paisely smoking jacket, a white oversized overcoat, and a pair of thick-rimmed Coke bottle glasses. Thankfully, not all at once.

That said, the ending made me laugh out loud.
