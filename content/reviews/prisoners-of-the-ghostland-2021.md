In a post-apocalyptic near-future, imprisoned bank robber Nick Cage finds himself forced to retrieve corrupt governor Bill Moseley's granddaughter. <span data-imdb-id="tt0082340">_Escape from New York_</span> segues into <span data-imdb-id="tt0089530">_Beyond Thunderdome_</span> as Cage ends up stranded in a colony of wasteland survivors battling a group of mutated felons. Bonkers, but not as bonkers as you might expect. Cage and Moseley entertain, but the hour-forty running time drags.
