Competent--if unremarkable--_Charlie Chan_ mystery. Bela Lugosi cuts a striking figure as an enigmatic psychic who may--or may not--figure in a starlet’s murder in Honolulu.

Warner Oland carries the film as Chan. His casting proves problematic by today’s standards, but his performance never ventures into mean-spirited caricature. Otto Yamaoka’s turn as Chan’s assistant, however, both annoys **and** offends. At least it’s a minor role.

The location photography adds a sense of prestige, and I loved Dwight Frye turning up in a meaty (though uncredited) part, but, post-<span data-imdb-id="tt0021814">_Dracula_</span>, Lugosi deserved better.
