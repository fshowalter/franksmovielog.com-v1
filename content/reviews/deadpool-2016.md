Beneath the crude jokes and over-the-top violence lurks a serious film. Okay, maybe not, but _Deadpool_ walks a tonal tightrope with no safety net.

<!-- end -->

Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson, a former special forces operative turned mercenary with a heart of bronze. After finding happiness with the girl of his dreams, Wade learns he's developed terminal cancer. A mysterious organization promises a cure. Wade accepts, but the cure carries a steep price. Presumed dead, Wade sets out for revenge, complete with running commentary.

_Deadpool_ plays as a self-aware comic book film. On my first viewing, I laughed so hard I missed most of the jokes. Besides the non-stop non sequiturs, the script proffers jokes about the plot, the other X-Men films, and the limited budget. They're not belittling the genre, just mining it for laughs.

And said laughs come wrapped in a solid origin story. Credit to Reynolds. He propels the film along with his effusive charisma, his deadpan comedy proving the perfect fit for the characterâ€™s gallows humor.

There's an adage that one can mark a genre's end when it devolves into comedy, as <span data-imdb-id="tt0040068">_Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein_</span> ended the _Universal Monsters_ era. But Deadpool proves otherwise, delivering engaging narrative and emotional stakes _and_ a liberal dose of comedy.
