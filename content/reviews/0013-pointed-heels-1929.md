Watched on the same site I found <span data-imdb-id="tt0019758">Charming Sinners</span>. This was a better quality print but a lesser quality film. There's a lot to like: William Powell is charming as ever, Helen Kane provides the inspiration for Betty Boop and even sings her signature number, the camera is mobile in a few scenes [^ Rare in early talkies because the camera itself had to be encased in a soundproof booth that usually anchored it to the spot.], Fay Wray plays a great drunk, and the script shows more than it tells.

But the result never gells. Despite his top-billing, Powell's a supporting player, off-screen for much of the first two acts. Wray tries to carry the film herself but gets no help from her chief co-star, Phillips Holmes. There's a great meta-scene halfway in where Powell--who plays a Broadway producer here--and frequent co-star Skeets Gallagher are watching the show-within-the-show and grimacing at its awfulness. One suspects that scene was easy to play.
