Ingmar Bergman's slow-build drama focuses on two women. Susanne owns a successful modeling agency but yearns for her former lover, a married man. Doris, younger, models for Susanne. She has just split with her fianc√© and yearns for a more attentive partner. A trip to Gothenburg sees both women disabused of their fantasies in two of the most acerbic scenes I've seen. They left me floored. The reductive ending disappointed, but there's a through-line here to Neil LaBute's best work.
