I liked the ingredients, but the recipe feels off. Eline Kuppens wowed me with her fearless performance as Marie, and I appreciated her character's rich backstory and agency. But the film's blend of folk horror, body horror, trap movie, and Lynchian weirdness didn't gel. Each genre comprises one or more plot threads, some of which the film leaves unresolved.

The resulting ending left me bewildered. Outside of the obvious, the narrative intent eluded me. Maybe a second viewing will offer more clarity, but I'm in no rush.
