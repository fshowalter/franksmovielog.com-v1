Pierce Brosnan debuts as James Bond in the franchise's 17th entry. I remember catching it on the big screen during its initial run and loving it. It holds up well. The mix of action and light humor harkens back to Roger Moore's better installments. Campbell may be more journeyman than auteur, but he delivers an entertaining product.
