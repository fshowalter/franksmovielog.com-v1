**Boris Karloff's first talkie.** His contribution comes via a bit part as lead Warner Baxter's vaguely Arabian manservant. Though billed as a mystery, the film plays as a melodrama. Baxter and Lois Moran play would-be lovers kept apart by Moran's murderous, philandering husband and the script's insistence that Moran behave like an impetuous child.
