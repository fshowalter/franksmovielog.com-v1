The costumes and dialog evoke <span data-imdb-id="tt0065466">_Beyond the Valley of the Dolls_</span> mod. The shot-choice, saturated colors, and gentle grain ape Eurosleaze thrillers. But the story of a San Francisco witch desperate for love proffers neither mania nor mystery, making for a pleasant but uncompelling watch.
