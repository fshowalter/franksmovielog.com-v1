On Halloween night in Salem, Massachusetts, a transplanted L.A. teen inadvertently resurrects three witches, played by Middler, Parker, and Najimy. With a single night to live, they attempt to steal the town's children's life to extend their existence.

Kudos to the Salem location photography, but this reeks of studio notes. The teen protagonist and incessant virgin references point to a darker tone and older target audience. The tag-along kid-sister and stagey presentation skew toward traditional G-rated Disney adventure fare. And nobody's reigning in Middler, who's delivering full-on camp. Everyone's making a different movie and none are very good.
