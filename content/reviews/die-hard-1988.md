“It will blow you through the back wall of the theater!” Does anyone remember that tagline from the film’s trailers and print ads? It makes no sense, yet it’s my go-to description for folks new to _Die Hard_.

The plot--NYC cop Willis finds himself in the wrong place at the right time to foil a group of armed assailants in a Los Angeles high-rise--birthed the “fly-in-the-ointment” genre. <span data-span-imdb-id="tt0105690">_Under Siege_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0118571">_Air Force One_</span>, <span data-imdb-id="tt0106582">_Cliffhanger_</span>, and countless others copied the formula with varying success.

Alan Rickman's performance birthed the “suave European villain” trope that dominates action films to this day. One could argue a through-line between his icy yet charismatic turn here and Anthony Hopkins’s award-winning portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in <span data-imdb-id="tt0102926">_The Silence of the Lambs_</span>.

The crackerjack script layers the cat-and-mouse between Willis and Rickman’s gang atop a solid heist movie. Indeed, you could remove Willis’s character and still have an interesting--albeit scaled-down--picture. Rickman’s part proves every bit as memorable, and his captivating battle of wits with the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. holds our attention. It’s the secret sauce that elevates _Die Hard_ above its imitators.
