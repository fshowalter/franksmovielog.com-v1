**Reminds me of a great bit from <span data-imdb-id="tt0118655">_Austin Powers_</span>:**

Except that's in **this** movie. Both hit theaters in 1997, so that'sâ€¦ something? I dunno. Everything looks cheap: the sets, the car, the effects, even the clothes. Makes a compelling case for **Worst Bond Movie**. Insert joke about Ricky Jay wishing he could disappear from this turkey. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0143145">_The World Is Not Enough_</span>.
