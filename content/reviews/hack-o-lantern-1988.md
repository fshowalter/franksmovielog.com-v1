**So-bad-it's-good schlock** sees Hy Pyke masterminding a satanic cult in rural California. He's out to initiate his incestuous son on Halloween night. '80s fashions, nice location photography, and Pyke's grand-camp performance buoy the wooden acting and specious plotting. Not for everyone, but lots of fun.
