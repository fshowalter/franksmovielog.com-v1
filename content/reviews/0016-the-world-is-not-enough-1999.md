I remember, when this came out, the reviews savaging Denise Richards' casting as a nuclear scientist, but I don't think that was fair. The the script called for a female nuclear scientist named Christmas Jones that could also pose as high-class prostitue for a Russion black-market gangster. To that end, the casting is inspired. In for a penny, in for a pound or some such.

Apted acquits himself better than his predecessor, Rodger Spottiswoode, by making the first-act speedboat chase seem more expensive than the entirety of <span data-imdb-id="tt0120347">Tomorrow Never Dies</span>.

Also, Robert Carlyle could have been a great Blofeld. I'll save this for when we get to the Craig series, but how great would it have been if they'd done a parrallel series of films chronicaling Blofeld's rise to power as an anti-Bond?
