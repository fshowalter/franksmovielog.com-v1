Gigolo Powell romances a married older woman and flirts with her daughter played by Lombard. A chance encounter with Francis forces him to reconsider his lifestyle, but perhaps too late. Powell's sheer charisma overcomes the flimsy plot and his suspect casting. I couldn't buy him as a gigolo, but I _could_ buy him as a con man. Perhaps that's why the dark ending surprised me.
