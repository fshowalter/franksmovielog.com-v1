Follows <span data-imdb-id="tt0035692">_Border Patrol_</span> and <span data-imdb-id="tt0036016">_Hoppy Serves a Writ_</span> in the _Hopalong Cassidy_ series. Hoppy and his deputies buy a ranch and settle down, only to run up against a crooked cattle baron played by Victor Jory.

Weakest of the three _Cassidy_ films I've watched so far. Lots of filler shots, lingering takes, and Andy Clyde's tepid slapstick. That said, Robert Mitchum shines in his meatiest (albeit shortest) part in the series thus far, playing yet another outlaw grunt.
