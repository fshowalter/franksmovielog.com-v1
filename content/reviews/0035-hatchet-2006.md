Takes the â€™80s slasher formula, adds a liberal dose of humor, and executes with a diverse and talented cast.

Subbbing southern California for Louisiana drains the budget and constrains the shot selection, but the practical effects are top-notch, inventive, and gruesome.

Enjoyed it enough to buy the Blu-Ray for the commentary tracks.
