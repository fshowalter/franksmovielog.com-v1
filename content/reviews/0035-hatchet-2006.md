Takes the ’80s slasher formula, adds a liberal dose of humor, and executes with a talented cast and a boatload of heart. Sure, subbing arid southern California for a Louisiana swamp drains the budget and constrains the shot selection, but the practical effects are top-notch, inventive, and gruesome.

Enjoyed it enough to buy the Blu-Ray for the bonus features (which don’t disappoint).
