A bad _Friday the 13th_ film, but not a bad possession film. This entry makes no effort to pick up where <span data-imdb-id="tt0097388">part eight</span> left off, instead Jason opens the film alive and chopping. But government agents are waiting and, in a hyperbolic sequence, blow him to pieces.

<!-- end -->

But Jason lives on by possessing various other bodies. He transfers his consciousness by vomiting a cucumber-thick black worm into his next host. His goal being to possess someone within his own bloodline so he can be reborn.

This film introduces a lot of backstory. We learn Jason has a sister. We also learn a grieving Pamela Voorhees may have become interested in the occult and used dark magic to revive her son. I liked this idea. It resolves some of the series's early timeline ambiguity and better explains Pamela's actions in <span data-imdb-id="tt0080761">part one</span> and Jason's undead status. But such details are best left to fan-fiction. Jason's scarier when we don't understand. When things aren't nice and tidy.

On a brighter note, this entry features one of the series's best kills. In one of only two woodland sequences, a Jason-possessed character impales a teen mid-coitus then jerks the spear up, splitting her torso in two like the T-1000 in <span data-imdb-id="tt0103064">_Terminator 2_</span>. Never mind the inanity of the Jason-possessed individual trekking miles just to kill these random kids. Unless that's part of the dark magic curse that fuels him… but I digress.

I never feel the urge to revisit this entry. When I'm in the mood for a _Friday the 13th_ film, this won't quench that jones. It's not a woodland slasher and only features Jason-proper during the opening and closing scenes. But I must admit, whenever I do revisit it, I'm always surprised by how well it executes the rare moments it hews to the series formula, and how “not bad” it proves during the rest.
