How does one review this movie? A surrealist tale presented as a series of vignettes, the film offers no story. The lone through-line concerns two lovers struggling to consummate their relationship.

But the imagery, oh the imagery. A woman enters an ornate bedroom to find a large steer atop the bed. The cow stumbles off the bed and tramps around, sowing chaos. The woman pays it no mind. At a gala party full of upper-crust types set inside a mansion, a giant horse-drawn cart pushes through the partying masses who appear oblivious to its presence. Later, a servant screams and collapses, jets of flame shooting over her prone body. Again, the guests appear oblivious. A groundskeeper shoots an impish child. The guests notice, but their attention wanes fast.

_L’Age d’Or_ abounds with such striking moments, and at just over an hour long, doesn’t overstay its welcome. It's a film I can neither understand nor forget.
