I like John Wayne, but I struggled with _Haunted Gold_.

<!-- end -->

It was the first movie produced under a six-picture contract Wayne signed in 1932 to remake some Ken Maynard westerns. See my review of <span data-imdb-id="tt0022681">_The Big Stampede_</span> for details. This one remakes <span data-imdb-id="tt0019268">_The Phantom City_</span>.

Wayne plays a cowboy investigating an abandoned mine. It's a dull, talky story involving half-shares in mines, frame-ups, betrayals, and a mysterious Phantom. One assumes Maynard's version had more life.

Wayne's performance is stiff and unsure, lacking even a glimpse of his signature laconic persona.

And then there's Blue Washington as Wayne's sidekick. It's an unfunny and demeaning role that sees him run around wide-eyed, scared of every shadow and beholden to superstition. In once scene, Wayne refers to him as “boy,” and in another the villains note his “watermelon accent.” It makes an awful movie even worse.

Warner Bros. may have known they had a turkey on their hands. They shot and released two more Maynard remakes with Wayne, <span data-imdb-id="tt0023396">_Ride Him, Cowboy_</span> and _The Big Stampede_, before releasing this stinker.
