An amalgam of found-footage, trap movie, and J-horror whose merit will depend on your context. At best, I found it derivative. At worst, a pastiche. I love a good trap movie dooming its protagonist from the start, but _The Canal_'s protagonist proves an idiot. He refuses multiple offers of help and exhibits no common sense. The script strives to address these gaps in the third act but itâ€™s too little too late.

The execution proves more than competent. It mimics the best found footage and J-horror films. The third act practical effects, though not earned, prove gruesome. Employing such formal rigor in service of a better story might have proved special.
