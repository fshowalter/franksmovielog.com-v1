Rupert Evans plays a film archivist worried his supermodelesque wife is cheating on him. When she turns up missing, he suspects a malignant force living in the walls of his home.

An amalgam of found-footage, trap movie, and J-horror featuring solid execution but lacking originality. At best, I found it derivative. At worst, a pastiche. I love a good trap movie dooming its protagonist from the start, but The Canal's protagonist proves an idiot. He refuses multiple offers of help and exhibits no common sense. The script strives to address these gaps in the gruesome third act, but it's too little, too late.
