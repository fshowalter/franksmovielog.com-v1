Hitchcock's first sound picture. A Scotland Yard constable covers for his girlfriend after realizing she's implicated in a murder. The two then fall afoul of a blackmailer. <span data-snippet>Hitchcock shot this as a silent then added the sound scenes later and it shows, but his formal mastery is still amazing.</span> Love the rack focus reflection shot in the opening sequence.
