And here I thought I might have been too hard on Behind That Curtain. Hitchcock's first sound picture demonstrates more formal mastery in the first few minutes than Behind That Curtain can muster during its entire running time. The plot concerns a Scotland Yard constable who realizes his girlfriend is implicated in a murder and attempts to cover for her, only for both to fall afoul of a blackmailer. It's not a perfect film--Hitchcock shot it as silent picture originally, and went back and added sound scenes later--but it does set the bar for films of that era.
