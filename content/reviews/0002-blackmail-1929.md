Hitchcock's first sound picture follows a Scotland Yard constable who realizes his girlfriend is implicated in a murder and attempts to cover for her, only for both to fall afoul of a blackmailer. It's not a perfect film--Hitchcock shot it as silent originally then added sound scenes later--but his formal mastery is well advanced. Love the pull focus reflection shot in the opening sequence.
