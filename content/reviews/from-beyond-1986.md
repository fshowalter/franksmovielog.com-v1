A terrific discovery, _From Beyond_ plays like a pulp <span data-imdb-id="tt0093177">_Hellraiser_</span>. The transgressive practical effects proved delightful, and the cast straddles the fine line between EC Comics-style heightened performances and camp. Indeed, the entire film walks the tonal tightrope with success, save when a character produces a cartoonish explosive (complete with timer) to initiate the finale.
