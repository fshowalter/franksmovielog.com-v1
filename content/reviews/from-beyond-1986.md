In the attic of a creaking New England mansion, two scientists create the resonator, a device capable of bridging the barrier to a parallel dimension. But the denizens of said dimension claim one of the scientist for their own via a gruesome murder. Jeffrey Combs plays the surviving scientist whose mental scars land him in an institution. Barbara Crampton plays a psychiatrist who springs Combs to help her recreate the experiment. Disaster ensues.

EC Comics pulp meets <span data-imdb-id="tt0093177">_Hellraiser_</span> kink. The transgressive practical effects delight, and the cast straddles the fine line between heightened performances and camp. Indeed, the entire film walks a tonal tightrope with success, save when a character produces a cartoonish explosive (complete with timer) to initiate the finale.
