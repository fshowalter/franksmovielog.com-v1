The opening got my hopes up. It picks up right from the tag ending Curse of Chucky. X returns as Andy who's now a young man suffering from post traumatic stress disorder following the events of the first three films. We meet him on a date that, of course, doesn't go well once she realizes his past. Andy returns to his isolated cabin. Weapons line the walls. He stars drinking, then opens a secret safe and removes a badly mangled Chucky who he's been keeping prisoner. Chucky cracks wise about his failed date and Andy begins torturing the demonic doll.

I loved this setup. The final showdown between Andy and Chucky. I was onboard. 

But then the film shifts. We rejoin X from Curse of Chucky, now in a criminal institution. No problem, I can roll with this. Curse was one of my favorite entries. Some plot happens and she's transferred to a lesser security prison. This proves to be the film's primary setting. An isolated concrete obliesk full of stark white hallways and snowy exteriors. I loved the snow. 

Anyway, Andy's forgotten as we get a story involving Chucky and the other inmates. He shows up in the finale as something of an afterthought. Not Scatman Caruthers bad, but headscratcher nonetheless. 

This one's an odd duck. There's a lot to like. In addition to the above highlights, Chucky gets the funniest line of the series, referring to another antagonist: "I'm not sure if I should kill him or just take notes!"

But the opening tease of a final showdown between Andy and Chucky never materializes and the ending left me underwhelmed. Yes, it serves as a finale for the series, but it feels like the Andy bits were grafted onto an existing story. Said story isn't bad, but not what I wanted from the finale.
