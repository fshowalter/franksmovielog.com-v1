And so it comes to this. After an improbable ten-year run spanning six films whose lone through line was Warwick Davis as the titular Leprechaun, the franchise concludes with its worst entry.

<!-- end -->

An animated introduction proffers an origin story for the leprechaun. Perhaps the filmmaksers thought this overdue, but it foreshadows their misunderstading of the franchise. One doesn't watch a Leprechaun film for continutity.

Recycling the prior film's setting, we're once again in south-central Los Angeles, where a group of twenty-somethings discover the Leprechaun's treasure chest, leading to his resurrection as he seeks to reclaim it.

A fine-enough setup, but it takes an interminible near thirty minutes to get the leprechaun up and killing. Instead, we endure over-emoted melodrama involving a bad-boy drug dealer with a heart-of-gold, his ex-girlfriend, her best-friend, their stoner side-kick, and another bad-boy drug dealer with a heart of not gold.

Compounding matters, once Davis beings his murder spree, the kills disappoint. The cartoonish, over-the-top deaths that highlighted prior entries are out, in favor of simple stabbings. At least they're graphic. At one point the Leprechaun loses an eye in a mess of green blood and gore.

The film proffers some humor via a gag where the stoned Leprechaun attempts to find a snack, and another sequence where he tries to woo a girl over the phone by hinting at his physical endowment, but these bits fall flat.

The lone successful gag involves the leprechaun stealing a police car only to discover he can't reach the peddles and leveraging a severed limb to solve the problem.

But for most of the film, the Leprechaun proves interchangable with any generic monster. The notion of perverese wishes is gone, and, unlike part four, which also grafted the Leprechaun onto an unrelated story, Davis doesn't even speak in rhymes.

Davis seems to sense the impending end. He looks tired in most of his scenes, perhaps due to the meager budget's compressed shooting schedule, or perhaps due to disappointment with the material. Regardless, I don't blame him. He, and the franchise, deserved better.
