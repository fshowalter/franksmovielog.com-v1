Joe E. Brown heads west with his skirt-chasing cousin, ending up in Pasadena where he enrages a towering South American, played by Bela Lugosi. Grating and unfunny from the outset, Brown’s shtick annoyed me, and that’s all the film offers. Miscast as a Latino heavy, Lugosi compounds the error by over-emoting.
