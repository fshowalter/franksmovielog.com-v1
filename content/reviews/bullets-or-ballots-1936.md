Edward G. Robinson plays a hard-nosed detective fired during a corruption probe. He punches out his former boss, the chief of police, and joins mobster Barton MacLane's rackets. But MacLane's menacing lieutenant, played by Humphrey Bogart, doesn't buy it.

Second-billed Joan Blondell plays a small-time numbers game operator in an extraneous part. Frank McHugh offers comic relief as one of Blondell's helpers.

Bogart shines as a trigger-happy gunsel. He's all cool menace, conveying a simmering anger bubbling below the surface. His scenes with MacLane and Robinson crackle.

A competent Warner Bros. gangster picture. It precedes the superior <span data-imdb-id="tt0029864">_The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse_</span>, which features Robinson and Bogart in similar roles. The story proves predictable, but Robinson carries things well, playing a super-tough guy who ain't afraid of nobody, see?
