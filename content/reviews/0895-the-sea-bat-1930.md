Escaped convict Bickford arrives in a small Caribbean village posing as a priest and gets tangled up with local vamp Torres who's promised herself to any man who can slay the giant Manta-Ray that killed her brother. Great production and Bickford's entertaining performance can't overcome Torres's incessant emoting. Boris Karloff has a forgettable part with a couple of lines.
