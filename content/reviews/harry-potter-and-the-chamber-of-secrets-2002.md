Engaging--albeit overlong--sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0241527">
_Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_</span>. Harry, Ron, and Hermione race to uncover the culprit behind several petrifications at Hogwarts. I enjoyed the atmosphere and world-building, but wished Columbus had coaxed a better performance from Radcliffe and toned down Grint's mugging.
