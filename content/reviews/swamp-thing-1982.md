Ray Wise plays a scientist working deep in the swamp on a top-secret government project. Adrienne Barbeau plays a government agent who arrives on-site. Sparks fly between her and Wise, but before the romance can blossom, a James Bondesque supervillain played by Louis Jordan raids Wise's lab. This results in a freak accident that transforms Wise into a half-plant/half-man thing. The Swamp Thing. Gifted with superhuman strength and regenerative abilities, the Swamp Thing sets out protecting Barbeau from Jordan and his goons.

It's a pulpy story played out in a pulpy manner. The location photography and an early burning man stunt appear to exhaust the film's budget. The Swamp Thing suit and makeup and the remaining stunts feel on-par with top tier episodes of _The Incredible Hulk_ and _The Dukes of Hazzard_. Disappointing, but if you can adjust your expectations down from modern superhero fare, it proves a fun ride.
