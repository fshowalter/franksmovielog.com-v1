The film proves a rarity. Neither erotic thriller nor Giallo, it’s a genuine mystery. The competent cast and location photography held my interest, but couldn’t compensate for the low narrative stakes. I can imagine the story resonating more in novel form, with a decompressed timeline.

That said, Rapace crushes it in a fearless performance that held me riveted.
