Mario Bava’s directorial debut. A hybrid mystery and mad-scientist picture. In contemporary Paris, young women are turning up drained of blood. The press labels the killer a vampire. Michaelis plays a reporter determined to uncover the culprit. The case leads him to his estranged cousin and her gothic castle and the secrets it holds.

Bava--who also serves as cinematographer--evokes a memorable gothic atmosphere with his use of light and shadow. He also pulls off a special effect reminiscent of Lon Chaney’s famous transformation in <span data-imdb-id="tt0034398">_The Wolf-Man_</span> that holds up today.

That said, he can’t overcome the predictable script leaden with exposition.
