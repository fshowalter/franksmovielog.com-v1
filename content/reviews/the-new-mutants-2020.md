We meet an assortment of angst-ridden teens with lethal mutant powers imprisoned in a hospital resembling a boarding school. Teen drama ensues, culminating in a big CGI finale. The single location and shallow characterization make this play like the pilot for a TV series. I liked Maisie Williams's performance, but I knew her character from the comics and may have imported more depth than the film proffered.
