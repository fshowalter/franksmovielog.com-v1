**Sam Peckinpah's feature debut.** Brian Keith plays a former Union soldier escorting dance-hall singer Maureen O'Hara through Apache country. Peckinpah had neither script nor edit control, rendering this a mediocre work-for-hire effort. Not a good film, but passable thanks to Keith and the strong supporting cast.
