A dark farcical take on _The Most Dangerous Game_ pitting America's political extremes against one another. The biting satire takes no sides, and its nihilistic message--that only a sociopath can survive--resonated. It's not without problems—an immigrant sub-plot makes no sense, and a certain actress's reveal proves anticlimactic despite her terrific performance—but this film feels refreshingly dangerous. How else to explain one of my biggest laughs coming when a woman gets shot point-blank in the face?
