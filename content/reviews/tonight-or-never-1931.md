A romantic comedy starring Gloria Swanson as a prima donna criticized for her passionless performances because she's never made time for a man. To remedy this, she falls for convenient handsome stranger Melvyn Douglas, but an idiot plot causes her to believe him a gigolo. Putting aside the plot's overt sexism, I struggled with Swanson's petulant, egomaniacal character. Boris Karloff appears in a single scene as a hotel waiter.
