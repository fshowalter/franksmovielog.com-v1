A back-to-basics sequel set in an old house full of long shadows and creaky doors. Outside, a perpetual thunderstorm rages. Inside, a wheelchair-bound young woman realizes the toy doll in her home may have supernatural powers. Throwing back to <span data-imdb-id="tt0094862">the original</span>, we have a young moppet. But unlike the early films, she's not central to the plot and disappears for the finale. Instead, the film proffers a surprising sexual thriller alongside the traditional bit where our leads must acknowledge and thwart Chucky. I loved the gothic atmosphere and found the performances entertaining throughout. And for franchise fans, the post-credits tag proves brilliant.
