In the late 90s, everyone was championing <span data-imdb-id="tt0117571">_Scream_</span>’s revival of the horror genre, citing its self-aware script, and upending of the genre tropes. But the genuine evolutionary leap occurred a year later, in Austria, with this film. Besides resuscitating the home-invasion genre, _Funny Games_ proves more self-reflexive and layered. All while packing the nihilistic punch _Scream_ lacked.

Calling this a home invasion movie would be reductive, but as an example of the genre, it’s amazing. What begins as an awkward comedy of manners with a stranger asking to borrow some eggs transforms into unsettling terror via sudden, brutal violence. And it gets darker. Much darker. At times, the film proves off-putting but writer-director Michael Haneke goads us on, daring us to continue.

And that's the meta dimension that makes _Funny Games_ so revolutionary. Haneke has always challenged his audience, but with this film, he’s transitioned from presenting a disturbing vision to inviting us along in its creation. He’s not challenging us to stare into the abyss. He’s forcing us to examine why we enjoy it.
