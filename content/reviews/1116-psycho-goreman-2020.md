The title threw me. Not the official "Psycho Goreman" but the more often used "PG: Psycho Goreman". I get how writer-director X was making a play on the MPAA rating, but for me it backfired, conjuring images of watered down Amblin-esque horror. I was half-right.

Writer-director x does lift his premise from the Amblin playbook. Tween siblings unearth an alien being in their backyard, but said alien is no E.T. He's a murderous, demonic exteraterrestrial overlord who spends his first scenes dispatching a crew of hoodlems in a hilarious, over-the-top gorefest. 

The hook emerges when one of the tweens--played to precocious perfection by Y--discovers the alien must obey her every command. From here the film careens into a gleeful parody of the aforementioned Amblin schmaltz. She names the beat Psycho Goreman and with a contagious certantiy of purpose conscripts him as her playmate. Goreman maintains his murderous rage, however, and steals all his scenes with his direct dialog. Think Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy. 

It's not for everyone but fans of 80s horror will find this a real treat. I had some great laughs and look forward to a second viewing.
