William Powell plays New York City's best “promoter.” If you've got an idea for a business, he'll mastermind drumming up investment dollars. His one catch: the deal must be legit. As he says, anyone can put over a swindle, but promoting a real deal takes skill. George Sidney brings him a proposition involving synthetic rubber and soon Powell has an army of salesmen pressing the hard sell on scores of potential investors. Think a tamer <span data-imdb-id="tt0993846">_Wolf of Wall Street_</span>. Things take a turn when the Attorney General demands they prove their ability to produce rubber. Not a standout, but I enjoyed it. Powell's charming as ever and director Mervyn LeRoy keeps his foot on the gas. Only the romantic angle between Powell and Evelyn Brent underwhelmed. Frank McHugh turns up early as Powell's right-hand man.
