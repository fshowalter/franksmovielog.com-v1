_Port of Call_ proffers a social outrage drama akin to Bergman’s earlier <span data-imdb-id="tt0038468">_It Rains on Our Love_</span>, but lacks that film’s sense of whimsy. Jönsson charms as a troubled factory girl desperate to escape her life, but I struggled with Eklund as a dock worker who can’t forgive Jönsson’s past. His stoic countenance through most of the film borders on opaque, robbing his talky, emotive third-act tirade of its impact. Given the similarities to _It Rains on Our Love_, this feels like a step backward for Bergman.
