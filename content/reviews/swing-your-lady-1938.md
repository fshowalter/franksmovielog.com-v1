Humphrey Bogart plays a wrestling promoter who takes his flagging show to the Ozarks, where he arranges a match between his star and a she-hulk blacksmith. Complications arise when the would-be grapplers fall in love.

<!-- end -->

On the plus side, Bogart's not playing a heavy. This concludes the plus side.

The melodramatic love triangle between Bogart's wrestler, the blacksmith, and the blacksmith's hick boyfriend split time with assorted “Hollywood Hillbilly” musical numbers lead by Penny Singleton. Think lots of banjos, fiddles, bonnets, and suspenders.

Speaking of Singleton, she plays Bogart's would-be love interest. She and Bogart have no chemistry. Indeed, Bogart seems to sense he's in a turkey. Much of the proffered comedy comes from Nate Pendleton's simpleton performance as Bogart's wrestler, Joe Skipapoulos.

To-wit, Bogart and his entourage talk code by spelling out words they don't want Pendleton to hear, as one would talk around a toddler. To this, Pendleton replies, “Aw, talk United States, will ya?”

Or later, when Pendleton meets his lady-love blacksmith and introduces himself.

“Joe Skipapoulos,” he says.

“What are ya, Italian?” she asks.

“No, I'm a freak, actually,” he says with a proud smile.

At least the film's flagrant about wrestling's staged nature. Before the big bout between Pendleton and the hick boyfriend, he's handed the whiskers he'll pull off the boyfriend's face. Of course, the match comes with the requisite drama. First Joe has to throw the match, then a surprise plot twist necessitates he reverse course and win. Regardless, we lose.
