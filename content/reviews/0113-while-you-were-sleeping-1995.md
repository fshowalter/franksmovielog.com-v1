Lonesome CTA worker Bullock saves the life of handsome stranger Gallagher, then poses as his fiancee as he slumbers in a coma only to find herself falling for his brother, played by Pullman. Fine but forgettable romcom buoyed by the wintery Chicago location photography and carried by Bullockâ€™s innate charm.
