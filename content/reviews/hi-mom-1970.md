A sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt0063036">_Greetings_</span> that sees Robert De Niro reprising his role as Jon Rubin, now a Vietnam War vet returned home to New York City.

Director Brian De Palma retains the prior film's vignette structure, with Rubin opening the film attempting a career in voyeuristic porn, then joining a militant theater group, before going deep undercover himself.

As with _Greetings_, I loved the New York City photography. And I enjoyed seeing De Niro's growth as a performer. But once again, I struggled to connect with the film's humor. Granted, _Hi, Mom!_ proved more accessible than _Greetings_--the "Be Black Baby" theater sequence in particular. But I still felt I was missing context and nuance a 1970s audience would have grasped.
