Robert Mitchum plays a mercenary looking to turn a quick profit during the Mexican revolution by helping Gilbert Roland and his band of rebels hijack arms dealer Zachary Scott's shipment of guns and ammunition meant for the federals. Things get complicated when Mitchum starts to fall for Scott's wife, played by Ursula Thiess. Great location photography, a strong supporting cast, and a short running time make for a surprisingly good adventure. Just don't think too much about how the characters keep finding each other.
