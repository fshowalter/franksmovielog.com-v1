Picks up where <span data-imdb-id="tt1270835">part 2</span> ends. The bigger budget manifests in location photography and formal rigor that match the script's ambitions. Crowley is a hulking, roaring beast. The script's usual mix of humor and violence includes some well-timed self-deprecating laughs. A belabored side-plot involving the original films' heroine and a reporter drags but almost pays off with a laugh-out-loud cameo from Sid Haig. Edges the original for my favorite of the series thus far.
