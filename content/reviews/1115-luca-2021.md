An entertaining--if unremarkable--tale of a young sea-monster boy who visits the surface world and discovers he can turn into a human when dry. There's some plot involving another sea-monster boy, a human girl, a bicycle race, and a Vespa scooter, but the film's standout draw is the sense of 1950s atmosphere. To that end, it does a terrfic job conjuring what I imagine 1950s small-town Italy must have been like. It's charming and packs a few belly laughs, but at ninety-five minutes proves underwhelming.
