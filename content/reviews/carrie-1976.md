I'd seen _Carrie_ at least twice prior. I remembered it as a competent, albeit unremarkable Stephen King adaptation. Having now seen director Brian De Palma's prior films, I came away from this viewing with a renewed appreciation. This is De Palma's baby, for better and worse.

From the opening crane shot depicting a girl's volleyball gym class match, De Palma's inventive camera work shines. We meet Carrie White, played by Sissy Spacek. A near-silent sequence tells us all we need to know about her alienated status.

Spacek shines in the part, convincing as both a burgeoning woman and frightened child.

We soon learn Carrie is telekinetic. An awkward scene with Carrie verbalizing a library book definition of telekinesis hammers this point home.

These elements collide when a popular girl named Chris springs a disgusting trick on Carrie at the prom. Carrie snaps and lashes out with supernatural fury. A sequence De Palma plays out in his now-signature split-screen technique to great effect.

I came in familiar with King's novel and the changes De Palma makes speak to the film's biggest shortcoming. Piper Laurie plays Carrie's overbearing zealot mother, Margaret. I liked Laurie in the role, but the character proves less physically imposing than King's vision. Chris's boyfriend Billy, played by John Travolta, deviates from the source too. He's a bit more charming and goofy than the sociopathic goon in King's novel. The best way I can articulate these changes and the missing elements in the film itself is that it feels more urban. De Palma doesn't capture the isolated small-town feel. A place where monsters like Billy and Margaret can grow unchecked because small towns don't have monsters. Compare Travolta's character here to Kiefer Sutherland's Ace Merrill in the later King adaptation, <span data-imdb-id="tt0092005">_Stand by Me_</span>. Or Laurie's character to Kathy Bates's Annie Wilkes in <span data-imdb-id="tt0100157">_Misery_</span>. _Carrie_ is a good movie and a decent King adaptation, but De Palma may have been better served adapting more urban material.
