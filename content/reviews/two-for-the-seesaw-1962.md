Robert Mitchum plays a middle-aged, midwestern lawyer who abandons his cushy job and pampered lifesyle for New York Ciy after his wife of twelve years asks for a divorce. He meets a late-twenty-something dancer played by Shirley MacLaine. A romance blooms. Spoilers follow.

There's something off about Two for the Seesaw. It struck me from the first frames. Michum's wrong for the part. At the time, I thought a younger Henry Fonda would have been perfect, and was surpised to learn the film originated as a stage-play wth Fonda and Anne Bancroft as the leads. I don't think the fifty-seven-year-old Fonda would have worked in this film, but thirty-seven-year-old one would have been dynamite.

The problem with Mitchum, besides looking at least five to seven years older than his forty-five, lies in his nature. Michum oozes a laconic confidence, yet his character comes to New York City suffering a mid-life crisis, seeking to prove to himself he can stand on his own after living a coddled, cushy lifestyle financed by his wife's father.
