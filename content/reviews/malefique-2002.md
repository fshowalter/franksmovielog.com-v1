_Maléfique_ opens with a man named Carrère saying goodbye to his wife and young son. He is a white-collar criminal and today marks his first day in prison. We meet his cellmates: Lassalle, an older librarian of few words, Marcus, a brash young man whose large breast implants clash with his brawny physique, and Pâquerette, a man-child with a penchant for eating things.

After establishing these characters and their interpersonal dynamics, the plot kicks into gear. The men discover a moldy diary that doubles as a spell book. Eager to escape, the men try some incantations but discover magic carries a high cost.

I relished this premise. Taking four desperate (but not fierce) men and dangling a supernatural means of escape lies right up my nihilistic alley. The trap-like plot burrowed deeper into my wheel-house.

The cast performs well. As Carrère, Gérald Laroche's underplayed transformation into a bitter convict serves as a grounded audience surrogate. As Lassalle, Philippe Laudenbach adds gravitas, communicating volumes with his weary looks.

It had me riveted until the third act. The strong setup had me hoping for a knock-out finale. Instead, the story devolves into a predictable version of [_The Monkey’s Paw_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey's_Paw), with a _Tales from the Crypt_ ending.

Imagine a film that took these characters--one imprisoned in his body, one in his mind, one in his wealth--and explored their prisons and the lengths they would go for freedom. _Maléfique_ is not that movie. It's not a bad film, just one that falls short of its potential.
