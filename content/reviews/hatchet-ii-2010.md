Picks up where <span data-imdb-id="tt0422401">_Hatchet_</span> ends. The sole survivor (played this time by Danielle Harris) returns with a group of well-armed hunters to exact revenge on Victor Crowley.

Though plot-heavy, this sequel maintains the first film’s look, feel, and heart. The practical effects remain top-notch and the Victor Crowley makeup proves _much_ better, but the shot selection remains limited and I missed Deon Richmond’s comedic timing.
