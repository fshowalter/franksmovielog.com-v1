Joe E. Brown heads west with his skirt-chasing cousin, ending up in Pasadena where he enrages a towering South American, played by Bela Lugosi. Grating and unfunny from the outset, the film tested my patience. Brown’s schtick annoyed me, and that’s all the film offers. None of the supporting cast furnish the faintest spark of charisma, including Lugosi, who seems lost. Maybe he’s wondering how he got cast as a Latino named Pancho Arango.
