William Boyd returns as Hopalong Cassidy, now a Texas Ranger who uncovers a shady mining town controlled by a despotic mayor, played by Russell Simpson.

This entry follows <span data-imdb-id="tt0036016">_Hoppy Serves a Writ_</span> in the _Hopalong Cassidy_ series, carrying over much of that film's cast but working from a better script.

Boyd's still an odd fit for a western hero, but this entry doesn't see him brawling with men half his age. It also tones down the slapstick. Casting the older Simpson opposite Boyd proves a double boon. He provides a good foil and makes Boyd appear youthful in comparison.

Claudia Drake's character starts as an annoying, bull-headed stereotype, but I appreciated the third-act affording her a surprising amount of agency.

Robert Mitchum, in his third movie, plays another forgettable goon, albeit one with more lines.
