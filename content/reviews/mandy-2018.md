Nicolas Cage plays a logger in the Pacific Northwest living a bucolic life with his girlfriend Mandy. A Manson-like cult invades their home, murders Mandy, and leaves Red for dead. But Red survives and descends on the cult like a hellish spirit of vengeance.

Imagine fitting David Lynch, Clive Barker, and Sam Raimi with headphones pumping out doom metal, dosing them with LSD, then capturing their fever dreams. That's an inkling of _Mandy_. You don't so much watch it as _experience_ it.

It won't appeal to everyone--it's a slow burn and Cosmatos veers far into the formal. But if it scratches your itch like it does mine, there is no substitute.
