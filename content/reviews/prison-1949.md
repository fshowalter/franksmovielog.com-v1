**Bergman's first feature from his own screenplay.** An ambitious movie-within-a-movie following a writer, played by Malmsten, who falls for a prostitute, played by Svedlund. Bergman proffers a dark--bordering on nihilistic--point of view throughout and flexes his formal muscles in an extended dream sequence. The result didn't resonate--the dream sequence felt pretentious--but I appreciated the uncompromising vision. The scene where Malmsten and Svedlund laugh at a silent film's inanity to escape their own misery proved a standout.
