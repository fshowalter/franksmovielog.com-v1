Michael Nyqvist plays a disgraced journalist recruited by an aging tycoon to investigate a forty-year-old murder. Noomi Rapace, in a fearless performance, plays a troubled investigator drawn to Nyqvist and his investigation.

More mystery than thriller, the competent cast and location photography held my interest, but couldn't overcome the low narrative stakes.
