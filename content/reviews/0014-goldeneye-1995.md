Brosnan's debut as James Bond. First of the franchise I saw during it's original theatrical run. I remember loving it at the time and it holds up well. The mix of action and light humor harkens back to Roger Moore's better installments. Broson's take is colder than Moore's but he's pure sunshine compared to Dalton's prior turn in the joyless-but-ahead-of-its-time <span data-imdb-id="tt0097742">License to Kill</span>.

I never gave Campbell the credit he deserves for this picture--thinking him more journeyman than auteur--but if he's a journeyman, he's one of the best. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0120347">Tomorrow Never Dies</span>.
