Brosnan's debut as James Bond harkens back to the best of Roger Moore's installments. His take is colder than Moore's but still packs plenty of humor, and it's pure sunshine next Dalton's prior turn in the joyless-but-ahead-of-its-time <span data-imdb-id="tt0097742">License to Kill</span>. I never gave Campbell the credit he deserves for this picture--thinking him more journeyman than auteur--but if he's a journeyman, he's one of the best. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0120347">Tomorrow Never Dies</span>.
