Billy Warlock plays a Beverly Hills teen who begins to suspect his parents and the other wealthy-types are part of a sinister conspiracy. 

I liked Warlock in the role. He's got Rob Lowe's combination of strong jaw and cheekbones but delicate facial features that makes him believable as a Beverly Hills teen. Good genes, soft life. His smaller stature has everyone towering over him, and his performance apes Michael J. Fox's awkward charm. 

But the ending sells the movie. Without spoiling it, suffice it to say it's a gran-goigal spectacle that proves a triumph of practical effects. Both sickening and fascinating, but above all, resonent.
