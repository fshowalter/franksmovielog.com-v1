Billy Warlock plays a Beverly Hills teen who begins to suspect his parents and the other wealthy-types are part of a sinister conspiracy. 

<!-- end -->

Plays like a paranoid thriller where you get the sense early _something_ is wrong, but the fun comes in how far director Brian Y pushes. It goes from sinister to weird to unsettling sometimes all in a singe scene. But despite the serious subtext, Y maintains a streak of dark humor throught the film.

I liked Warlock in the role. He's got Rob Lowe's combination of strong jaw and cheekbones but delicate facial features that makes him believable as a Beverly Hills teen. Good genes, soft life. His smaller stature has everyone towering over him, and his performance apes Michael J. Fox's awkward charm. 

But the ending sells the movie. Without spoiling it, suffice it to say it's a gran-goigal spectacle that proves a triumph of practical effects. Sickening, fascinating, and above all, resonent.
