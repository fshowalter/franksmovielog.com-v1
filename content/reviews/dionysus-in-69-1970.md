Brian De Palma films the Performance Group's stage play adaptation of Euripides's _The Bacchae_. Experimental theater fans might enjoy it, but I found it pretentious and opaque. De Palma uses a perpetual split-screen to simulate the theater-in-the-round experience, but it proves a poor analog. William Finley's performance--his final monologue in particular--provided the lone highlight.
