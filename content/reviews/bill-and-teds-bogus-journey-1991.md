A disappointing sequel that manifests its bigger budget via more effects and product placement, but lacks the first entry's amiable tone. The heightened narrative stakes involve a future revolutionary, evil robots, and the afterlife. The abundant night shots point to a rushed production. Only the scenes with William Sadler as the Grim Reaper recapture the first entry's goofy sense of fun.
