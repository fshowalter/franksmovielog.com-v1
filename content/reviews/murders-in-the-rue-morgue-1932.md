Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist injecting blood from his sideshow ape into abducted women. I appreciated the stylish cinematography and cooky mid-nineteenth-century Paris production design. But the talky script (with dialog punch-ups by John Huston!) and lame ape-suit effects proved too much. The scariest thing about this movie was Lugosi's unibrow.
