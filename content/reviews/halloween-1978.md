Once upon a time, Goldilocks wanted to watch _Halloween_. First, she reached for the 2007 Anchor Bay Blu-ray, but found the colors too saturated, too warm. The daylight scenes looked artificial. So she reached for the 2013 Blu-ray, but found the picture too dark, the blue hue too pronounced. Characters disappeared into the shadows. It was too cold. Finally, she found the 2021 Shout Factory 4k. It's still dark, but not too dark. The outdoor scenes looked natural, and the dark scenes still held detail. It was just right.
