During the Irish Civil War, a working-class family comes into an unexpected inheritance that proves their undoing. Hitchcock limits his formal rigor to long takes that mimic a stage performance. The result drowns in dialog rooted in Irish working-class social norms circa 1922. Worse still, the film drops the source play’s final go-for-the-throat nihilistic scene. There’s a reason the best print I could find came sourced from a DVD that often crops the performer’s heads.
