I'd long considered Dario Argento's sophomore effort a disappointment, but upon revisiting I discovered a competent--albeit unremarkable--mystery film.

The story follows a blind puzzle enthusiast, played by Karl Malden, who teams up with a reporter, played by James Franciscus, to investigate a convoluted series of murders involving a medical institute.

It may lack <span data-imdb-id="tt0065143">_The Bird With The Crystal Plumage_</span>'s visual flair and intensity, but it ages better. Argento appears to have learned that showing a character afraid isn't enough to engage an audience. He comes close with a scene where Malden traps Franciscus in a tomb, but the scene proves short. Instead, Argento focuses on solid mechanics. The result is the tortoise to _Bird_'s hare.

First-time viewers may find this disappointing after _Bird_. But give it time. As I'm learning, a film can age in unexpected ways.
