A brilliant deconstruction of '80s horror tropes that doubles as a meta trap-movie. It's so snug in my wheelhouse, itâ€™s as though they wrote it just for me.

I first saw this at a midnight premiere show. I remember laughing so hard my cheeks hurt and being awestruck by the ending. Eight years and five rewatches later, the film still impresses.
