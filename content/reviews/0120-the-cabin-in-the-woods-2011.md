There's wit to spare in Whedon and Goddard's literate horror film deconstruction as it lays bare the genre's tropes in their logic-defying glory. Their "loving hate letter" to the genre is self-referential almost to the point of parody as it serves up equal parts genuine thrills and acerbic black comedy. That it doubles as a meta trap-movie places it so snug in my wheelhouse, it's as though they wrote it just for me.
