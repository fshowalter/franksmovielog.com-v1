Looking to repeat the success of The Quatermass Xpermient, Hammer Productions tapped Val Guest to adapt another Nigel Kneale TV script. Unlike Quatermass, this story feels stale. Peter Cushing plays a botanist who hitches a ride aboard Forret Tucker's Himalayan expidition to find and study the legendary Yeti. Of course, Tucker's motives prove less than scientific. And of course, the party fall victim one-by-one to the mostly-unseen monsters.

The talented cast could overcome the script's by-the-numbers approach but the laughable special effects prove a bridge too far. Also not helping: Maureen Connell's turing and walking toward the camera to convey dramatic emphasis. Still this proves an important film, marking Cushing's first of 22 horror films he'd star in for Hammer films.
