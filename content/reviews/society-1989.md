A satirical paranoid thriller starring Billy Warlock as a Beverly Hills teen who uncovers a sinister, far-reaching conspiracy. The fun comes in how far the film will push its boundaries. Where other movies stop at suspenseful, _Society_ pushes through to weird, disturbing, and gross.

I liked Warlock as the lead. His look reminded me of a young Rob Lowe. Strong jaw and cheekbones, but delicate facial features. Convincing as a good-genes-soft-life Beverly Hills teen. His smaller stature has everyone towering over him, ala Michael J. Fox, and he conveys a similar awkward charm.

But the ending sells the movie. A Grand Guignol practical effects spectacle that shocks, sickens, and resonates. You won't forget it.
