John Wayne's first starring role. He's good but raw--on par with the poverty-row oaters he'd make for the next nine years. He plays a trapper leading a wagon train up the Oregon Trail. The script includes the requisite character drama and love interest, but they're better viewed as a movie-within-a-movie. The real star here is the production itself.

After a talky, inert opening, things get moving and the film shifts. It's like Raul Walsh set out to make a melodramatic epic but ended up making a pseudo-documentary. The spectacle must be seen to be believed. They shot everything on location. The rain storms aren't special effects. They cross a river, and wagons and horses get washed away. They lower wagons down a muddy cliffside to sometimes disastrous results. All in 70mm wide-screen. Warner Herzog would be proud.
