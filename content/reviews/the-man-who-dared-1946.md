**The directorial debut of John Sturges.** George Macready plays a crusading reporter who seizes an opportunity to expose the fallacy of circumstantial evidence, only to find himself convicted of murder. Top-billed Leslie Brooks plays his girlfriend, who endeared herself to this viewer by avowing her favorite meal as “steak with hash brown potatoes.”

The meager budget manifests in small recycled sets, limited action, and lots of exposition. Nothing to recommend outside of a nice silhouette shot during a foot chase. An inauspicious debut for Sturges.
