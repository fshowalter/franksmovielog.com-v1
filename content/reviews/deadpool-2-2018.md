Ryan Reynolds returns as Deadpool, a disfigured mercenary with superhuman healing abilities and a heart of gold. Or at least bronze. This time he's drawn to protect an angry mutant boy, played by Julian Dennison, from Cable, a time-traveler played by Josh Brolin. Cable's here to assassinate the boy, as he grows up to murder Cable's family.

Lots of laughs and thrilling action set-pieces, and Zazie Beetz proves a charismatic revelation as Domino, a mutant whose superpower is luck, but this entry fails to rival <span data-imdb-id="tt1431045">the first installment</span>'s emotional stakes. Dennison's good in his role, but I struggled to invest in his character, rendering my first viewing something of a disappointment.

Revisiting the film with lowered expectations proved worthwhile. The comedy holds up, and the bigger budget translates into superior action sequences, both of which distract from Dennison's tepid arc. My biggest gripe this time? Who dressed Josh Brolin in that gray onesie?
