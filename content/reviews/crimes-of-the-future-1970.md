Cronenberg's second outing proves analogous to <span data-imdb-id="tt0065036">_Stereo_</span>, but shoots in color and opts for first-person narration. The result proves more accessible, albeit far darker.

The nihilist in me loved it, but the stiff narration robs it of what would otherwise be a knockout gut-punch. Worth a look for Cronenberg fans for the strong through line to his later body-horror films.
