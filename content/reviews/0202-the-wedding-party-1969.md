Groom-to-be X arrives on Y with friends Z, and Robert De Niro to wed A. After encountring her eccentric family he has second thoughts.

De Palma's first filmed (but third released) feature sports a servicable cast--including a very young De Niro--but the director proves the real star. From the opening drive, De Palma presents numerous equences that play like silent comedy, bypassing the technical logistics of sound and performing demands of dialog. It's an interesting watch, but only occasionally amusing. The execution may shine, but the script proves lacking.
