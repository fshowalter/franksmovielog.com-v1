Two young documentary filmmakers focusing on conspiracy theories stumble upon a centuries-old cult comprising the world's most powerful people.

This impressed me on my first watch years prior. Revisiting it, I found it less resonant. I still appreciated the inventive technique and clever script, but its insistence on treating the cult as a faceless entity frustrated me. Alpha personalities don't act as a collective. So, who's pulling the strings? Who's dominant enough to force presidents and tycoons to fall in line? That's the actual terror. Without a human identity, the film proves easier to dismiss. Imagine <span data-imdb-id="tt0070917">_The Wicker Man_</span> without Christopher Lee's chilling Lord Summerisle.

Still, the film merits a look, if only to appreciate the crafty way the script strings together various popular conspiracy theories to fashion its own.
