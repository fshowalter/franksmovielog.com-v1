**William Powell's third outing as amateur detective Philo Vance.** After the disappointing <span data-imdb-id="tt0019949">_Green Murder Case_</span>, the franchise returns to form with a closed-circle mystery pitting Powell against a notorious bootlegger. The early thunderstorm generates a terrific atmosphere and the eccentric supporting cast sprinkles in the right dose of light comedy.

I'd like to revisit a better print. All the uploads online appear sourced from the same low-res scan.
