Right in my nihilistic, trap-movie-loving wheelhouse. I bought everything Toni Collette's all-in performance was selling. Aster's unwavering commitment and sure-handed execution surprised me. More than once, I dismissed a plot point as lazy writing, only for it to twist and punch me in the gut. And I loved the ending.
