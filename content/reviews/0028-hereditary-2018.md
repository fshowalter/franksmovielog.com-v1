Right in my nihilistic, trap-movie loving wheelhouse. Fronted by an all-in performance from Toni Collette, writer-director Ari Aster's debut feature tells an ambitious story about a doomed family. Saying more about the plot would venture into spoiler territory, so suffice it to say the film surprised me with its commitment and Aster's sure-handed execution. More than once, I'd dismiss a plot point as lazy writing only to have it twist and smack me in the gut. Like The Witch, I suspect this will only get better on subsequent viewings.
