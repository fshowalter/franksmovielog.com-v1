Norwegian pre-med students travel to a remote snowbound cabin where they encounter Nazi zombies.

It takes <span data-imdb-id="tt0083907">_Evil Dead_</span>'s setup, stirs in <span data-imdb-id="tt0103873">_Dead Alive_</span>'s manic, over-the-top gore aesthetic, and tops it off with the monsters from <span data-imdb-id="tt0076704">_Shock Waves_</span>. I loved it.
