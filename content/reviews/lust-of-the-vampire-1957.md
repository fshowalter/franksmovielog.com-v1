**Mario Bava’s directorial debut.** A hybrid mystery and mad-scientist picture. In contemporary Paris, young women turn up drained of blood. The press screams vampire. Dario Michaelis plays a reporter determined to uncover the truth. The case leads to his estranged cousin, her gothic castle, and the secrets they hold.

Bava--who also serves as cinematographer--exerts expert control over light and shadow to evoke a lush gothic atmosphere. And--as special effects lead--pulls off a transformation sequence reminiscent of Lon Chaney Jr.’s in <span data-imdb-id="tt0034398">_The Wolf-Man_</span>.

But Bava's visual prowess can’t overcome the predictable script leaden with exposition.
