The bizarre story of a boy who suffers a fright and loses his hair. The ghosts of two winos proffer a formula for hair growth which he botches, leading to hair that won't stop growing. He goes from bald at breakfast to Cousin Itt by dinner. Soon he's kidnapped by a maniacal paintbrush manufacturer and doped on yogurt while his never-ending hair serves as raw materials for paintbrush bristles. It's the sort of dark fantasy I enjoyed as a kid and appreciate as an adult. Not a great movie, but I appreciate its refusal to talk down to its audience and the resulting dissonance. **What did I just watch?**
