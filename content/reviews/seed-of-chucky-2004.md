**My favorite of the series so far.** The prior entries helped me appreciate this one's unpretentious approach. It opens with a stylish sequence shot from the doll's point-of-view that embraces the sleaze the franchise had been lacking. This sequence and the follow-up both feature a British cast. Then the film pulls back the curtain to reveal a <span data-imdb-id="tt0111686">_New Nightmare_</span> style movie-within-a-movie. It's a sleazy, gory, funny bit of nonsense that revels in its B-Movie nature. Jennifer Tilly's fearless, self-deprecating performance deserves more notice.
