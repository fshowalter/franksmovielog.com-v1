**William Powell's second talkie and first leading role.** He plays Philo Vance, a dilettante detective who uses “psychology” to solve the locked-room murder of a notorious showgirl.

Powell's great, delivering an early version of the urbane sleuth he'd perfect in the <span data-imdb-id="tt0025878">_Thin Man_</span> film series. Bonus points for the script's good red herrings and extended poker scene. Look fast for Pat O'Brien[^1] as a desk sergeant. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0019949">_The Greene Murder Case_</span>.

[^1]: Maybe. I couldn't find a supporting source.
