A contemporary <span data-imdb-id="tt0088258">_This is Spinal Tap_</span>. Andy Samberg plays Conner4Real, a pop star riding high on the eve of his much-anticipated sophomore release. The standard fall-from-grace-then-redemption plot follows, but the script's biting commentary on celebrity culture and Connor's catchy, hilarious, and often outrageous songs prove entertaining.
