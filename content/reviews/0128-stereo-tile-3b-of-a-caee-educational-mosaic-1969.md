David Cronenberg's first feature. The Canadian Academy of Erotic Enquiry (CAEE) conducts telepathic experiments with a group of young people. As the film unfolds, the organizers lose control of the experiment.

Shot as a silent film, with clinical voice-overs from unnamed narrators added later, I found the film near impenetrable, but intriguing. I recognized several recurring themes from Cronenberg's later films and appreciated the short running time of just over an hour.
