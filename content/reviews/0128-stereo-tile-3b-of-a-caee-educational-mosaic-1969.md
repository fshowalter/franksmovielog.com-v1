David Cronenbergâ€™s first feature. Proffered as an "educational" film from the fictional Canadian Academy of Erotic Enquiry, the film documents telepathic experiments conducted on a group of young people. As the film unfolds, the organizers lose control of the experiment. Shot in silent black-and-white, with clinical voice-over narration, the film parodies and exploits the "educational" films I watched in school.

I found the film near-impenetrable yet intriguing. It feels like a mid-series film (as befits the titel) but I recognized the through-line to Cronenberg's <span data-imdb-id="tt0081455">_Scanners_</span> and appreciated the short running time of just over an hour. Call it alpha-Cronenberg.
