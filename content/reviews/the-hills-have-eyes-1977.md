A murderous clan of cannibalistic savages descends upon an unwitting family stranded in the desert.

Wes Craven’s sophomore feature proves less disturbing than <span data-imdb-id="tt0068833">_The Last House on the Left_</span> due in part to the family’s hubris and myopic focus. Their cavalcade of poor decisions almost leaves you rooting for the savages.

And savage may be too harsh a term. The group operates with radio comms, decoy explosions, and timed raids. Paramilitary might prove more apt.

Lest you think Craven has lost all his edge, I appreciated the film’s willingness to imperil a baby. The savages—er, paramilitary hill people—refer to it as a “young thanksgiving turkey”. Good stuff.

The new 4k master looks terrific, but the HDR color grading felt off in a few third act scenes. The saturated blue sky lent more than one shot a soundstage appearance. A minor quibble with the film’s best presentation to date.
