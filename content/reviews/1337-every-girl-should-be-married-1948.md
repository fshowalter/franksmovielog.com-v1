Betsy Drake plays a department store clerk who obsesses over trapping a pediatrician, played by Cary Grant, into marriage.

<!-- end -->

It's meant to play as romantic comedy, but consider the plot: A young woman exchanges a few words with a pediatrician at a magazine stand. They go their separate ways, but she fixates on him. She shows up at his office. She scrounges through his trash for details of his life. She pumps his friends, associates, and ex-girlfriends for information. When none of this helps, she invents a relationship with her boss to make the doctor jealous. This lands the boss in hot water, but she doesn't care. When none of this works, she threatens the doctor's business.

Despite being based on a woman's story, this proves a male paranoid fantasy, albeit one targeted to women. What were they thinking?

I blame Grant. According to Marc Eliot's biography[^1], studio head Howard Hughes allowed Grant to rewrite much of the script and even direct several scenes to shift the visual emphasis from himself to Drake, his real-life girlfriend.

Hughes hoped to exploit Grant and Drake's off-screen chemistry (which blossomed to marriage a year after the film's release) ala Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.

But Drake is no Bacall, and Grant's direction does her no favors. She speaks as though she's trying to affect or mask an accent and the shot of her poking out of the kitchen pass-through window, cocktails in hand, a crazed smile on her face, had me laughing.

Indeed, they'd have been better served embracing the male delusion and staging the film as an over-the-top black-comedy horror. With someone like Billy Wilder behind the camera, it could have worked. But we'll never know.
