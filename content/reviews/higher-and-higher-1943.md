**Frank Sinatra's debut.** Not his first screen appearance, but his first proper role. Granted, he's playing a fictionalized version of himself, but this proves for the best.

The plot concerns a scullery maid, played by Michèle Morgan, who poses as a débutant to land a wealthy husband. Jack Haley plays the valet ringleader behind the scheme and the true object of Morgan's affections.

This one proved a chore. The script paints Morgan as an idiot. Instead of amusing, I found her myopic pursuit of Haley grating. Haley's inane blindness to Morgan's desires grated in equal measure. Along the way, the film proffers some of the worst backdrops I can remember.

At least Sinatra acquits himself well. He's stiff but earnest. Unlike Morgan and Haley, he seems to realize he's trapped in a turkey and doesn't pretend otherwise.
