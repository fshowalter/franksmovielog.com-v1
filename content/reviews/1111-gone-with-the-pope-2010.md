How do you review this? A film made in 1976 but not released until 2010, when editor Bob Murawski assembled the redicovered footage into a complete film. A film laden with casual racism but also featuring a very-of-the-moment soliloquey bemoaning the Catholic Church's culpability in turning a blind-eye to the world's problems. A film written and directed by a nightclub crooner, yet shot on-location in Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, and Rome. I shall begin with the plot.
