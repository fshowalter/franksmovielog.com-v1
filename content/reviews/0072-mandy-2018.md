If you compress an atmosphere enough, will it yield a tangible result? _Mandy_ would indicate yes.

Nicolas Cage plays a logger in the Pacific Northwest living a bucolic life with his girlfriend Mandy. A Manson-like cult invades their home, murders Mandy, and leaves Red for dead. But Red survives and, like the spirit of Vengeance, descends on the hellish cult.

Imagine fitting David Lynch, Clive Barker, and Sam Raimi with headphones pumping out doom metal, dosing them with LSD, then capturing their fever dreams. That's an inkling of _Mandy_. Writer/director Panos Cosmatos proffers no pastiche, however. His film delivers a laser-focused vision that distills multiple genres into their visual essence. You don't so much watch it as _experience_ it.

It's also the rare film that improves with every viewing--provided you liked it the first time. It won't appeal to everyone--it's a slow burn and Cosmatos veers far into the formal. But if it scratches your itch like it does mine, there is no substitute.
