Resurrected again, Chucky resumes his murderous quest to escape his artificial body.

<!-- end -->

Starts promising, with Chucky offing an exec in a posh high-rise office. Then the action shifts to a military academy. Andy's sixteen now and played by a different actor. The change of scenery proves welcome. As campus bully Shelton, Travis Fine provides a terrific secondary antagonist. It's not clear why Chucky's still after Andy, but the film glosses over this with some best-not-scrutinized dialog involving Chucky's resurrection.

But soon the film devolves into a retread of the prior entries. Andy may be older, but the script introduces a new moppet full of inane, plot-convenient behavior. <span data-imdb-id="tt0099253">The prior film</span> ended in a dangerous factory, this one ends in an equally non-OSHA-compliant amusement park ride. Like the first film, our female lead once again proves incapable of shooting a target a few yards in front of her. Worst of all, Shelton's fate proves unsatisfying.
