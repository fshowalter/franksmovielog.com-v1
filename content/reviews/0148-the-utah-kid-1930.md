Lease plays the titular Kid, an outlaw who falls for Sebastian, a woman kidnapped by his outlaw gang. Santschi plays Lease's outlaw rival.

I expected a B-grade oater but found it quite passable. The leads proved competent, and the photography and stunts above-average. Cringe-worthy dialog litters the clunky script, but the obligatory barroom brawl's visceral and kinetic choreography stood out, as did the blood from Lease's bullet wound. Karloff has a forgettable role as Santschi's henchman.
