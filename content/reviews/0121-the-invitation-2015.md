Logan Marshall-Green plays a man invited to his estranged ex’s house for a dinner party. He brings his new girlfriend. As the evening unfolds, he withdraws, suspecting something sinister afoot. Is he right, or has his own troubled past caught up with him?

Revisiting the invitation after several years, I found it even more engaging. I loved Marshall-Green’s underplayed performance. He conveys volumes in a single look.

I also loved the languid pace. On the rewatch, I recognized several hints pointing toward the film’s conclusion but appreciated how the film proves in no hurry to arrive there. It’s comfortable in awkward silences and long takes.

How best to conclude? While I enjoyed it, _The Invitation_ proves good but not great. It almost crumbles under the weight of its own gravitas. More memorable dialogue (embracing the inherent black humor) and fewer flashbacks would have helped. Still, Marshall-Green’s performance makes it an easy recommend for fans of darker thrillers.
