An unengaging adaptation of Se√°n O'Casey's play about a poor Dublin family undone by an unexpected windfall during the Irish Civil War. Hitchcock limits his formal rigor to constructing long takes which--combined with the monologue-heavy script--give the sense of watching a filmed stage performance. The film even drops O'Casey's final gut-punch scene. Often ignored in Hitchcock's oeuvre for good reason.
