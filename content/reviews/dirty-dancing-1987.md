**Not the dance musical I expected.** Instead, it proffers a coming-of-age drama closer to <span data-imdb-id="tt0087538">_The Karate Kid_</span> than <span data-imdb-id="tt0055614">_West Side Story_</span>. It's shot with a male gaze and even features even a training montage. Great sense of atmosphere and good chemistry between Swayze and Grey.
