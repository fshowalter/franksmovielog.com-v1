Alex Essoe plays Sarah, an aspiring Hollywood starlet. She endures rejection after rejection until an unusual audition lands her a callback for a horror film from a mysterious production company.

This one reminded me of <span data-imdb-id="tt0940723">_Left Bank_</span>. Essoe's performance wowed me, and I liked the mix of trap movie and body horror, but the execution left me wanting. The gruesome third act packs a wallop, but the slightest introspection reveals sizable plot holes, diminishing its resonance. Great score, however.
