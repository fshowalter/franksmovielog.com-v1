In the late 90s everyone was champoning Scream's revival of the horror genre, citing its self-aware script, and upending of the genre tropes. But the geniune evolutionary leap happened a year later, in Austria, with writer/director Michael Haneke's Funny Games. It's more reflexive, and not only upends genre tropes, it reinvigorated the home invasion genre. All this while still packing the nihilistic punch Scream and its imitators lacked.

Calling this a home invasion movie would be reductive, but as an example of the genre, it's amazing. What begins as an awkward comedy of manners with a stranger asking to borrow some eggs pushes past uncomfortable and into unsettling terror as Haneke traps his characters with their own manners. And it gets darker. Very dark. So much of this film will prove off-putting but Haneke dares us to keep going. Knowing we can't take our eyes off the train wreck despite the body count.

And its that meta aspect that makes Funny Games so revolutionary. Haneke has always challenged his audience, but with this film he's transitioned from presenting a disturbing vision to inviting us along in its creation. He's not challenging us to stare into the abyss, but rather, challenging us examine why we enjoy it.
