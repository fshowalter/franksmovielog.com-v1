A great character caught in a bad story. Powell plays “Natural” Davis, New York City's premier gambler, renowned for his charm and ethics. As a mark says early, “It a pleasure to lose your money to him.” I should love this movie. Powell in a Runyonesque role, the always reliable Kay Francis as his love-interest, and an extended poker scene as the climax. But the story has Powell’s hayseed younger brother arrive with dreams of beating the big-city game. You can see where it’s going. Kudos to the script for avoiding the telegraphed ending, but I couldn’t help wishing for a less melodramatic plot.
