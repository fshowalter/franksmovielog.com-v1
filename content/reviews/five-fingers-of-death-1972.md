A prestigious Kung Fu tournament. Two rival schools, one of which will stop at nothing to win. A promising young student. Imposing villainous fighters with exotic techniques. Despite the abundant tropes, the film surprised me.

<!-- end -->

To be fair, these elements were fresh in 1972. But today, the setup proves predictable. The student joins the “good” school, trains hard, and learns a secret Kung Fu technique. A rival student grows jealous. The “evil” school attempts to sabotage the student, providing smaller fight scenes before the big tournament. _Five Fingers of Death_ hits these beats, but surprises with a bloody third act full of unexpected carnage.

I loved the scenes filmed on location. Staging battles outside of a sound stage permits wider shots and removes some of the artifice. I say “some” because you’ve still got fighters splitting skulls with karate chops and trees with head-butts.

But the film proves judicious with such hyperbole. This results in finale pregnant with pent up tension. When our hero finally unleashes his new technique, it’s accompanied by a visual flair and sound cue that must have had 1972 audiences cheering. And you know what? It still works.
