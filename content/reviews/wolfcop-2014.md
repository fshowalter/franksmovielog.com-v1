**Ridiculous in the best way.** An alcoholic sheriff's deputy becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town.

In this age of SyFy originals, B-movies have devolved into homogenized camp "starring" D-list performers unable to disguise their contempt for the material.

Not _WolfCop_. Here we have a lurid, irreverent pulp creation from talented folks backed by a lot of heart. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.

Consider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dingy dive-bar bathroom. As he relieves himself, Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon.

I laughed and cringed in the same breath.

Ditto when WolfCop foils a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine.

With _WolfCop_, it's not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It's “What if a drunken cop stereotype became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror provides a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy-nine minutes. I loved it.

But the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn't it? Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt4515762">_Another WolfCop_</span>.
