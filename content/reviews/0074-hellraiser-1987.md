Clive Barker's debut feature. A married woman frustrated with her effete husband and sedate lifestyle discovers her former lover is now a skinless ghoul on the run from sadomasochistic creatures from another dimension summoned by a magical puzzle box. As one creature says, “We have such sights to show you!”

Barker delivers his cautionary tale with a wink and a grin. His creatures aren't evil monsters, but amoral entities dedicated to sensory extremes. “Demons to some. Angels to others,” they say.

The real monsters are, of course, the woman and her lover. Incapable of love, they're forever chasing the elusive pleasures of the flesh. They're sensation junkies.

It's a monster movie, slasher horror, and erotic thriller stirred up and strained through Barker's imagination. There's plenty of gore, but even more imaginative creature design and a nice streak of black humor[^The film's best jump-scare involves a statue of Jesus.]. I loved it.

And the remastered Arrow Blu-ray looks _fantastic_.
