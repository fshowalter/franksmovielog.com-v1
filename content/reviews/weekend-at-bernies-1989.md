I remember seeing this when it first landed on home-video. A pair of young professionals earn an invite to their charismatic boss's Hampton Island beach house. Upon arrival, they discover their host dead and themselves targeted for a similar fate. In the decades since, I'd forgotten how long it takes to get the pair to the beach and how few antics they employ to convince everyone their boss is still alive. Credit to Silverman and McCarthy for shining through their character's one-dimensional behavior and salvaging what they could.
