Ruth Chatterton plays a kept wife whose husband is conducting a not-so-discreet affair with her best friend. William Powell plays her former flame returned to town. The sinners in question (Chatterton's husband and best friend) prove far from charming, rendering the title a case of flagrant false advertising.

Watching Powell, it's fascinating to see him grow as an actor. In just his fourth talkie, he's already recognizing the importance of reacting during his dialogue exchanges.

But this is Chatterton's movie. Bonus points to the script for affording her real agency and even more bonus points to Chatterton herself for out-charming Powell and overcoming the disappointing ending.
