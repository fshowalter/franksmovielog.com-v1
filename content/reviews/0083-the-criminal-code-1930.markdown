Howard Hawks's second sound picture. A competent prison-reform drama that nevertheless feels like a work-for-hire job. Huston's electric as a former district attorney turned prison warden, but Holmes doesn't register as the hard-luck protagonist. Ditto Cummings as the love interest. Boris Karloff maximizes his meaty role as a grudge-bearing convict.
