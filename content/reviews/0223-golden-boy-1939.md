William Holden's debut. He plays a violin protégé turned boxer, egged on by his manager's mistress, played by Barbara Stanwyk. Lee J. Cobb plays Holden's disappointed father.

Holden's good. He's got the physicality to pass for a boxer, as well as the sensitivity, and vulnerability, to pass for an artist. He brings a believable naiveté to his part, along with a welcome lack of stage theatrics. And he's got great chemistry with top-billed Stanwyck, who sizzles in her vampy role.

But the film struggles to escape its theatrical origins. The talky script proffers crackling dialogue early, but devolves into stagey monologues. Lee J. Cobb's performance could have captivated from a stage, but film's intimacy renders it emotive and betrays the artiface of the makup used to make the twenty-seven-year-old actor pass for Holden's father.

The result proves uneven. For every electric moment between Holden and Stanwyk we get overwraught Cobb playing to the back rows. For every chilling line Joseph Calleia delivers as a mobster, we get pages of monologue from Holden's brother-in-law. A tigher edit would have helped, but as-is Golden Boy proved a frustrating watch.
