Two girls travelling from Italy to Germany by overnight train encounter two dangerous men. I didn't realize until the pivotal scene that this was a remake of Last House on the Left (itself a remake of The Virgin Springs). By that point the film had shown enough competence that I powered through the brutal, hard-to-watch rape sequence. I'm glad I did. Though structured as a rape-revenge picture, the ending proffers an acerbic condemnation of class-based justice that haunted me. The aforementioned sequence aside, the film proves well-produced with great location photography, chilling performances, and resonant editing. Not for everyone, but worth a look if you're up for the challenge.
