Brian De Palma’s debut feature. A young woman struggles to help her director boyfriend who’s filming low-grade sleaze to raise money to divorce his wife. Said sleaze includes an ice-pick murder that may or may not be real, among other sordid events. Style trumps substance as the film careens further and further into the surreal, but it proves an entertaining ride.
