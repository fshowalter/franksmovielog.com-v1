The fourth leprechaun film unfolds in the 21st century, where a group of merencary space marines working for an eccentric scientist hunt the leprechaun who's seeking to marry an alien princess.

That mouthful of plot hints at a pre-existing script punched-up to include the titular Leprechaun. It proves telling how, despite wearing his trademark green suit, and buckle hat, no one recognizes him as a leprechaun. He's referred to as "alien", "beast", or "monster".

And that proves the film's undoing. It's not a Leprechuan movie. While I appreciate the franchies's allergy to continuity, the third film landed on a winning formula: have somone steal a piece of the Leprechaun's treasure to gain wishes, then have the Leprechaun twist them in horrible ways as he attempts to reclaim his gold.
