A faux true-crime documentary covering the drowning death of a teenage girl. The performances convince and the narrative piles twist upon twist with deft precision. Every revelation feels earned, even as the film inches closer and closer to _Twin Peaks_-style horror. Add a star if you're a true-crime or documentary fan, but the style kept me at arm's length though I appreciated the craftsmanship. Great surround mix.
