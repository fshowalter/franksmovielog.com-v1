Reminds me of a great bit from Austin Powers:

> **Dr. Evil**: Are we ready to release our new software?
> \
> \
> **Number 2**: Yes, sir. As requested, it's full of bugs, which means people will be forced to upgrade for years.
> \
> \
> **Dr. Evil**: Outstanding.

Except that's in _this_ movie. Both hit theaters in 1997, so that'sâ€¦ something? I dunno. Everything looks cheap: the sets, the car, the effects, even the clothes. <span data-snippet>Makes a compelling case for Worst Bond Movie.</span> Insert joke about Ricky Jay wishing he could disappear from this turkey. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0143145">The World Is Not Enough</span>.
