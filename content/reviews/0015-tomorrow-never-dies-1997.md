Reminds me of a great bit from Austin Powers:

>
**Dr. Evil**: Are we ready to release our new software?

**Number 2**: Yes, sir. As requested, it's full of bugs, which means people will be forced to upgrade for years.

**Dr. Evil**: Outstanding.

Oh wait--that's an exchange from _this_ movie. Well, they both came out in 1997, so that's... something? Possibly the worst entry in the franchise. Everything looks cheap: the sets, the car, the effects. Insert joke about Ricky Jay wishing he could make himself disappear from this turkey. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0143145">The World Is Not Enough</span>
