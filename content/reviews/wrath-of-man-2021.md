Jason Statham plays an enigmatic loner who joins an armored car service and displays uncanny skills while thwarting an attempted robbery. The twisty script features plot holes big enough to drive said armored car through but with Statham leading this combination of heist and revenge flick, they prove easy enough to ignore.

The incessant shots of downtown Los Angeles invite comparisons to Michael Mann’s <span data-imdb-id="tt0113277">_Heat_</span>. This highlights the film’s biggest weakness. Statham’s great, but the script lacks a worthy antagonist. There’s no Pacino to his De Niro. Or is it the other way round? Regardless, this gap and the plot holes prove the difference between good and great.
