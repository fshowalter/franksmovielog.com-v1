**Howard Hawks's second sound picture.** A competent prison-reform drama that nevertheless feels like a work-for-hire job. Walter Huston's electric as a former district attorney turned prison warden, and Boris Karloff maximizes his role as a grudge-bearing convict. But Phillips Holmes doesn't register as the hard-luck protagonist. Ditto Constance Cummings as his love interest.
