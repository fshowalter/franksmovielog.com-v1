A bonkers story of a man who begins sprouting metal. It mixes <span data-imdb-id="tt0091064">_The Fly_</span>'s body horror with <span data-imdb-id="tt0074486">_Eraserhead_</span>'s visual esthetic, sprinkles in Clive Barkeresque kink and even packs a tokusatsu-style monster fight. The soundtrack evokes early Nine Inch Nails. All in under seventy minutes.
