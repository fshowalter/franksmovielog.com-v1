I watched _The Utah Kid_ because it features an early performance from Boris Karloff. As a solid B-oater with competent leads and above-average photography and stunts, it surprised me. Cringe-worthy dialogue may litter the clunky script, which has the titular outlaw Kid fall for a woman kidnapped by his outlaw gang, but the barroom brawl's choreography proved a standout, as did the Kid's bloody bullet wound. For his part, Karloff proves forgettable as an evil henchman.
