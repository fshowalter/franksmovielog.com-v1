An entertaining--if unremarkable--tale of a young sea-monster boy who visits the surface world and discovers he can turn into a human. There’s some plot involving another sea-monster boy, a human girl, a bicycle race, and a Vespa scooter, but the film’s standout draw is the atmosphere. It does a terrific job painting a nostalgic picture of 1950s small-town Italy. It charms and packs a few belly-laughs, but, at ninety-five minutes, feels overlong.
