An odd little movie that plays like an amateur production of a larger epic. The costumes and set decorations are nice, but they can't disguise the Southern California locales. The performers each proffer a different accent, none of them Russian. And Lionel Barrymore's character could pass for a younger version of Mr. Potter from <span data-imdb-id="tt0038650">_It's a Wonderful Life_</span>.

Still, director Raoul Walsh works with what he has. The big finale mixes equal parts drama and chaos to great effect. It left me wishing the studio had afforded Walsh wide-screen scope and a larger budget.

Boris Karloff plays a drunken porter in an uncredited part.
