Bette Davis's debut feature. Fox plays the titular opportunistic sister in an upstanding Ohio family who falls for con-man Bogart. Davis plays her long-suffering sister in a forgettable part. Bogie's fox-like in his first heel role, but the predictable plot and flat performances from leads Nagel and Fox sink this effort.
