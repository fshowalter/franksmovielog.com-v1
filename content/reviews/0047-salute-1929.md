John Ford’s second sound picture. O’Brien joins the Naval Academy, endures hazing from the upperclassmen, and rivals his older brother, a Westpoint cadet, for a girl. John Wayne and Ward Bond have small parts as O’Brien’s upperclassmen tormentors. The film culminates with the big Army-Navy football game pitting brother against brother.

Once again, the studio shackles Ford with a “dialogue” director, resulting in an uneven production. The outdoor scenes offer dynamic camera work and better performances. The indoor scenes play like stiff recitals. It’s not an unwatchable mess like <span data-imdb-id="tt0019699">_The Black Watch_</span>, but it’s not worth seeking out either.
