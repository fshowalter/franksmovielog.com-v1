James Farentino plays Dan Gillis the beleaguered sheriff of Potters Bluff, a coastal New England town small enough that everyone knows everyone. Gillis struggles to uncover the culprit behind a rash of murders, only to discover a far-ranging conspiracy. The producers added two extra death scenes to bump the gore-factor^["Gary Sherman". _Post Mortem with Mick Garris_. Podcast audio, Mar. 17, 2021.], one of which makes no sense and proves the lone blemish on what's otherwise an effective blend of beguiling atmosphere and inventive practical effects. A terrific EC Comics style horror.
