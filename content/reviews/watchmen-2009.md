In an alternate 1985 where the US won the Vietnam War and Nixon is still President, an aging costumed hero’s murder proves the tip of a dark conspiracy.

The source comics proffer a dense, self-reflexive deconstruction of the superhero genre mixed with a heady dose of Cold War paranoia and noir mystery. The film retains these themes and recreates much of the iconic imagery. It drops some sub-plots and tweaks the ending, but the intent remains true. An admirable adaptation.

I loved Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, our nominal protagonist. His fearless performance as a deeply flawed masked hero with uncompromising integrity proves riveting.

Ditto Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s turn as The Comedian, a hyper-violent brute of a man drowning in his own regrets but hiding behind a veil of cynicism.

It’s funny. Today’s darker superhero blockbusters wouldn’t exist without _Watchmen_’s source material, yet it took said blockbusters to convince the studios and audience for _Watchmen_ existed. Thus the film adaptation lacks the same revolutionary impact. But it still packs a punch.
