I'm becoming aware of a trope in horror films wherein we are subjected to a hard pause on the overarching threat while the leads engage in interpersonal conflict resolution. I suspect this grew out of Romero's zombie pictures, which painted humans as the bigger monster. Shows like The Walking Dead have continued this theme. Yet, I see it seeping into non-zombie films, often to disastrous effect. Imagine if, during Dracula, instead of rushing after the Count to save Mina, Harker pulled Van Helsing aside for a quiet sit down to apologize for not believing him earlier and explained this was likely due to his father's overbearing nature and distrust of science? Talk about ridiculous. All of which brings me round to saying I loved the first half of The Autopsy of Jane Doe.

The premise is simple. A father and son work as autopsists in a Virginia town small enough that they know all their subjects by name. One night the sheriff shows up with an unknown female corpse discovered at a grisly crime scene. The corpse appears pristine with no obvious cause of death. The father and son set out to discover what killed her, only to face unexplained phenomena during their examination.

It's a supernatural mystery and for the first half, it's terrific. Packed with atmospheric dread and bouyed by a charismatic performance from Brian Cox as the father, it invests us in its characters then places them in existential peril.

Then the story runs out gas. We get the aforementioned interlude where father and son have a heart to heart in an elevator and everything goes south. Lots of exposition follows as the film explains away all its mystery which in turn drains its ability to frighten. The ending becomes a foregone conclusion that compartmentalizes the menace.

It's not a total loss. The film packs some memorable visuals, and Cox's performance will have you wishing he was in all the things. But I couldn't shake the feeling that this one missed an opportunity to venture into Beyondesque levels of existential dread and nightmare logic, but opted to play it safer to appear to a wider audience. Disappointing.
