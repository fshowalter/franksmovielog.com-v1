How did I miss this off-beat 80s teen comedy that skews closer to Savage Steve than John Hughes? I loved the formal rigour director Phil Joanou brings to this simple tale of a dweeby kid who finds himself the target of his high school's ginormous new bully. From long takes of overlapping dialog to an always-interesting shot selection, the film proved a terrific discovery. That said, as much as I loved the cast, I wish the script had made Casey Siemaszko's character a bit more endearing. Oft times he's his own worst enemy. Thus, while I was always curious what was going to happen, I wasn't too concerned with what was going to happen to _him_.
