**My favorite movie** stars John Wayne as John T. Chance, a Texas sheriff struggling to hold a powerful land baron's brother for murder. <!-- end --> The land baron has an endless army of cutthroat mercenaries. Chance has a drunken deputy named Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled curmudgeon played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl played by Angie Dickinson.

The first ten minutes establish the premise with minimal dialogue. From there, the story unfolds at a languid pace. Much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one another.

And here, dear reader, I falter. I'm not sure why the film works so well. I can point to Wayne and Martin's charisma, but the film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn't coddle him, but it's not “tough love” either. Chance believes Dude will pull through. For Dude, Chance's faith proves stronger than any addiction.

It's a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, I believe it. Every time. Chance represents the strong, honest, capable, professional man I strive to be. Dude embodies the flawed, vulnerable man I feel I am. Chance's faith in Dude is Chance's faith in me. Every viewing of Rio Bravo delivers a low-key cathartic experience. It's not a heavy film--comic relief book-ends the most powerful scenes--but it punches above its weight.

And about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne's lines. Like Billy Wilder's best films, Rio Bravo uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, “Sorry don't get it done Dude,” I smirk at the delivery but the message resonates.
