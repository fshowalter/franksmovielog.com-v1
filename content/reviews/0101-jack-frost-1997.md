I first reviewed _Jack Frost_ in 2016 calling it "bad, even by movie-about-a-killer-snowman standards." What a difference a transfer makes.

I suspect Amazon's print comes via Vinegar Syndromey. The added grain and sharpened colors offer a filmic experience absent on my initial viewing. The improved visuals clued me into the film's asthetic: a loving homage to early 80s slasher and monster movies. It takes the traditional knife-wielding maniac or mutant monster and replaces them with a snowman. Otherwise--and here's the genius--the film plays it straight, just like those low-budget horror films.

The film opens with Federal agents transporting a serial killer (named Jack Frost, of course) to his execution. The icy conditions cause the paddy wagon to collide with a top-secret government tanker truck. The truck’s contents spray out and melt the killer's skin and bones. His liquid remains merge with the snow, granting him a second life as a snowman.

For that approach to work, the titular killer snowman needs to be an anti-hero; someone we can perversely root for as he offs the self-centered jerk taking up two parking spaces during the holiday rush, the obnoxious boss who overworks his employees on Christmas Eve, and yes, even the ungrateful kid who’s unhappy with his gifts.

_Jack Frost_ offers no such vicarious thrills. The serial killer turned snowman is out to fulfill a petty revenge pact against the small-town sheriff who arrested him. It’s an uninspired plot for an uninspired film that’s neither scary nor funny; and thus, not worth your time.
