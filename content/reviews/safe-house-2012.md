Ryan Reynolds plays a junior CIA agent manning a never-used safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The plot kicks in when he's charged with guarding a rogue agent played by Denzel Washington. Soon, the house is compromised Reynolds is unsure who he can trust. Reynolds and Washington are fine, and director Daniel Espinosa does his best Tony Scott, but almost everything about this film feels recycled, right down to the third-act twist, making the Cape Town locations the only original contribution, and that's just not enough.
