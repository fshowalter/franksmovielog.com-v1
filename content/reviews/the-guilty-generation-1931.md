Constance Cummings and Robert Young play lovers caught between their warring mobster fathers, played by Leo Carrillo and Boris Karloff.

<!-- end -->

Karloff opens the film with an electric scene confronting his estranged son Young, then disappears. Fortunately, Carrillo proves a strong substitute, turning in an entertaining performance that foreshadows Paul Muni's turn in <data span imdb-id="tt0023427">_Scarface_</span>. And Cummings shines as Carrillo's daughter. Impressive given she failed to register in <span data-imdb-id="tt0021770">_The Criminal Code_</span>.

An agreeable enough experience, but Carrillo proves far more interesting than the star-crossed lovers.
