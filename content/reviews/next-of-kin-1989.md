Patrick Swayze plays a Chicago cop caught between his job and hometown loyalties after mobsters kill his brother and his Appalachian kin demand revenge. The casting department deserves a revisionist award. Liam Neeson, Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, and Ben Stiller all turn up in supporting parts. The mix of procedural and revenge drama proves as believable as Neeson's country accent, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
