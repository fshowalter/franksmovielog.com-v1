Commentary rewatch. Screenwriter Roger Ebert proves entertaining and enlightening. He's self-deprecating without dismissing his work and praises director Russ Meyer.

<!-- end -->

Some notes:

- Meyer achieved the film's unusual tone by directing the actors as though they were playing a straight drama. This confused some, but Meyer's earnest discussions about their character's motivations convinced them.

- Ebert can't find Pam Grier either, leading me to believe she's not present in the final cut.
