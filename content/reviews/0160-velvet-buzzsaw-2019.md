The creatives behind <span data-imdb-id="tt2872718">_Nightcrawler_</span> reunite for a mix of satire and horror set in the world of high-end contemporary art. Jake Gyllenhaal plays an influential critic jockeying to exploit a batch of cursed artwork.

Gyllenhaal's incessant commenting on a funeral's decor choices had me laughing. Ditto the shot of school children tromping bloody footprints over a museum's pristine white floors. But these scenes mark the satire's limit.

I appreciated the horror's surreal presentation, but the central mystery didn't engage and the atmosphere never attained the level of dread present in better curse stories.

Would a straight satire or horror have yielded better results? I don't know. But with a title like _Velvet Buzzsaw_ this film proves far too restrained.
