Set in war-torn 1947 China, the _Left Hand of God_ sees Humphrey Bogart as a gruff priest struggling against a warlord played by Lee J. Cobb.

The film proffers several unusual sights, including Bogart in color (he only made a handful of color films), Bogart on horseback (he looks surprisingly comfortable), and Lee J. Cobb made up as a Chinese warlord. It’s that last one that really hurts the movie.

The film’s first half works well. Bogart’s engaging as a troubled priest. Gene Tierney is passable the female lead, and the great production values give the story a heightened sense of gravitas.

Then--just when the film seems poised to make a statement about faith and identity--it trots out Lee J. Cobb made up as a Chinese warlord. In doing so, it destroys its credibility. Though he’s nowhere near as over the top, Cobb still brings to mind Boris Karloff in <span data-imdb-id="tt0029754">_West of Shanghai_</span>.

Despite this near-fatal stumble, _The Left Hand of God_ remains entertaining, thanks to its brief 87 minute running time, great cinematography, and Bogart's ample charisma.
