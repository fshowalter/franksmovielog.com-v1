Restored to working order, Chucky resumes his murderous quest to sacrifice young Andy to escape his artificial body.

<!-- end -->

The lower budget sacrifices the first film's Chicago photography and exploding buildings. Much of this entry takes place in Andy's new foster family's suburban home--which does not explode.

On the plus side, Alex Vincent seems more comfortable as Andy. His character's still written as an idiot, but a less grating idiot. At least this entry revolves more around Chucky, who gets more screen time and exhibits a nice streak of black humor.

But the finale again proves lacking, with Andy and his foster sister playing hide-and-seek with Chucky in the most non-OSHA-compliant factory you've ever seen.
