John Wayne protects a woman and her miner father from the notorious outlaw Pandro Zanti, a “half white, half Apache Indian who poses as a Mexican.”

<!-- end -->

One of sixteen Lone Star westerns Wayne made for Monogram. These sixty-minute features prove interchangeable. They follow a cookie-cutter plot: Wayne arrives as a stranger in a frontier town, susses out trouble, and vanquishes the baddie. The scripts often incorporated pulp mystery elements like hidden passages, mistaken identities, and secret disguises.

_The Lawless Frontier_ gets a lot of mileage out of a secret passage in the miner’s cabin.

These productions shot back-to-back, each taking six days max. Thus, they recycle locations, sets, and cast. But unlike Wayne’s prior oaters at Warner Bros., which recycled action footage from Ken Maynard silents, these featured all original stunt work, much of it courtesy of Yakima Canutt.

These stunts prove the major differentiators between the films. _The Lawless Frontier_’s highlights include Wayne bodyboarding down a sluice run, and a fight sequence that sees him run up an incline, then jump backwards to body slam his opponent.

Besides doubling for Wayne and coordinating the stunts, Canutt also plays Zanti’s right-hand man.

Like all of Wayne’s Monogram releases, _The Lawless Frontier_ suffers from stilted dialog, wooden performances, and rushed production. These aren’t good films, but important ones. Their limitations, combined with their relentless production schedules and Wayne’s perpetual career insecurity, pushed Wayne to improve. Watching them is watching John Wayne as a work-in-progress. A curiosity for fans.
