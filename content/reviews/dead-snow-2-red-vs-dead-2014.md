Picks up where <span data-imdb-id="tt1278340">_Dead Snow_</span> ends. That film's lone survivor must stop Nazi zombies from destroying a small Norwegian village.

<!-- end -->

Not without charm, but disappointing. Though it retains the prior film's black humor and over-the-top gore aesthetic, its plot goes off-book with uneven results. The entire "Zombie Squad" sub-plot proves extraneous. And despite a bigger budget, this entry feels cheaper. The CGI blood is weak sauce, and while I appreciated the absurdity of setting the climactic battle in a small village, I missed the first film's wintry location photography.
