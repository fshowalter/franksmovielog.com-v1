Two former British soldiers now work as contract killers. Their latest job--the titular list--involves three targets, but things go sideways fast and the two find themselves in over their heads.

I loved the filmâ€™s trap movie plot--right in my wheel-house. Ditto the confident execution. The contrast between the dominant realism and the formal interstitial moments--such as the pair exiting their car framed by a rainbow--generates a perpetual sense of unease.

But the minimalist ending left me frustrated. I appreciated the lack of _Scooby-Doo_ style exposition, but the open-ended nature felt like <span data-imdb-id="tt4263482">_The Witch_</span> or <span data-imdb-id="tt7784604">_Hereditary_</span> without their closing scenes. Powerful, but lacking the final nihilistic gut-punch.
