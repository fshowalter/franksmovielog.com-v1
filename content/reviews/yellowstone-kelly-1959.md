**Warren Oates' first credited feature.** The story centers on the titular Kelly, a trapper played by Clint Walker who finds himself caught between a Sioux tribe, the US Army, and an alluring Arapahoe hostage.

The movie itself proves mediocre. Wide-open location photography shifts to a constrained soundstage for major scenes. The big action set pieces never escaped the modest budget.

But I loved Walker's performance. Standing six and a half feet tall, with broad shoulders and a granite jaw, he projects an almost superhuman appearance. Coupled with his baritone delivery, he's the perfect action hero. During the requisite brawl scene, he towers over the other performers like a man among children.

I also appreciated seeing <span data-imdb-id="tt0053221">_Rio Bravo_</span>'s Burdette brothers. Claude Akins, who played Joe, turns up an Army sergeant. John Russell, who played Nathan, shows up as a Sioux chief!

For his part, Oates proves forgettable in an inconsequential role as an Army soldier.
