Candy and Aykroyd are great, but John Hughes's script proves uneven. At its best, it's a great Vacation film, with Candy's part subbing for Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold. The skit-based structure reinforces the comparison. At its worst, the script's melodramatic rescue sequence foreshadows Hughes's lesser later work.
