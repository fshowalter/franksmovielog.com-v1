Rupert Evans plays a film archivist worried his supermodelesque wife is cheating on him. When she turns up missing, he suspects a malignant force living in the walls of his home.

An amalgam of found-footage, trap movie, and J-horror. Great atmosphere and stylish execution undermined by a frustrating script. I love a good trap movie dooming its protagonist from the start, but Evans's character proves an idiot. He refuses multiple offers of help and exhibits no common sense. The script strives to address these gaps in the gruesome third act, but it's too little, too late.
