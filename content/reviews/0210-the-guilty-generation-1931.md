Constance Cummings and Robert Young play star-crossed lovers caught in a gang war between mobsters Leo Carrillo and Boris Karloff.

Karloff opens the film with an electric scene confronting his estranged son Young, then disappears for the rest of the film. Fortunately, Carrillo proves a strong substitute, turning in a riveting performance that foreshadows Paul Muni's turn in <data span imdb-id="tt0023427">_Scarface_</span>.

Cummings shines as Carrillo's daughter. Impressive given she failed to register in <span data-imdb-id="tt0021770">_The Criminal Code_</span>. I enjoyed this one, but couldn't help feel the script's focus was misplaced, as Carrillo proves much more engaging than Cummings or Young.
