**Fulci’s most formal effort at the time.** A stylistic thriller revolving around a politician’s daughter who dreams of murdering her hedonistic neighbor, only to awaken and find herself the center of an actual police investigation.

Building on his prior thrillers, Fulci melds <span data-imdb-id="tt0065148">_One on Top of the Other_</span>’s panache with <span data-imdb-id="tt0064073">_The Conspiracy of Torture_</span>’s grindhouse exploitation. The result proves flashier than either of those films, but a cheat ending and a failure to exploit the London atmosphere render it the average--rather than the sum--of its parts. Stanley Baker’s commanding performance as the lead inspector _almost_ makes up the difference.

The Mondo Macabro Blu-ray takes special features to a new level. The supplemental documentary includes its own commentary track detailing the making of the making-of featurette.
