On the surface, _The Entity_ tells the story of single mom Barbara Hershey who finds herself under repeated, violent sexual assault from an unseen force. But just below said surface lies a scathing indictment of the patriarchy.

<!-- end -->

Everywhere Hershey turns for help, she finds men eager to dismiss, manipulate, or abandon her. First psychiatrist Ron Silver, who proves incapable of entertaining a supernatural explanation. Next, the parapsychologists, who treat her as a guinea pig in their experiments. And last, her boyfriend, who flees after encountering the malevolent force. None prove able to see beyond their own interests. She's alone.

This subtext, along with Hershey's fearless performance, almost overcomes the dismal third act which features a dated special effect involving a giant ice block and culminates in a non-ending.

I wanted to like this more. The performances convince and the narrative resonates, but that third actâ€¦ ouch.
