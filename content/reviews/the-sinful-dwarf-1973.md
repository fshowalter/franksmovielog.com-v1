Despite the game performance from Torben Bille, _The Sinful Dwarf_ bores.

<!-- end -->

The threadbare plot concerns a newlywed couple who moves into a seedy apartment building owned by a woman and her dwarf son, played by Bille. Unbeknownst to the couple, the woman and her son run a forced prostitution racket out of the attic. There, they’ve imprisoned a stable of women by hooking them on heroin. They set their sights on the new bride, who soon finds herself abducted.

It’s a boring, ugly, mean-spirited movie whose sole exploitive element is graphic sexual violence. The titular dwarf proves a non-factor, serving as Igor to his mother’s mad scientist. The film proffers no tension or suspense. We meander from one rape sequence to another. The lack of genuine menace surfaces when the new bride is abducted. One wonders why she doesn’t just overpower the older woman and her son.

The film’s single redeeming quality is atmosphere. The grime and seed are palpable. Were I on set, I’d be loath to touch anything.
