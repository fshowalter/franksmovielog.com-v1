A fascinating entry from writer/director Michael Haneke. Like his prior film, <span data-imdb-id="tt0109020">_71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance_</span>, it follows several disparate characters united by a single incident. But while that film built toward its climax, _Code Unknown_ opens with its converging incident then follows the rippling impacts through its character's lives.

The title proves apt. In an early scene, a character complains they can't enter an apartment building because the access code has changed. Haneke runs with this metaphor, examining the barriers to understanding and communication in our multi-cultural society. He presents no heroes or villains, or pat answers. Early on, we see a young west African man detained by police. Our sympathies go with him, but later, we see him exert emotional abuse on a date. Was it intentional, or a miscommunication? Haneke offers no clarity. Rather, he doubles-down on film's simulacrum, proffering scenes then revealing them as a movie-within-the-movie. He invites us to ask ourselves: does that make these scenes any less real?

The film's technical merits astound. Haneke films each segment in a single take, enhancing the voyeuristic experience.

Yet I came away disappointed. Unlike Haneke's prior films, _Code Unknown_ lacks a gut punch. The finale suggests a climax that never arrives. Then again, a tidy ending would betray the film's nature. I struggle to reconcile my initial disappointment with the film's continued resonance. Like the film itself, my reaction proves an enigma.
