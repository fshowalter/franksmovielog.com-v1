**Michael Haneke's devastating feature debut.** Calm waters of menacing monotony surrender to a crushing tsunami of bleak emotion. As the third act unfolded, I struggled to watch. It's not what Haneke shows, but what he _doesn't_ show. We fill the gaps with ourselves. The dread overwhelms. I went in cold, only aware that it concerned a middle-class couple. I suggest you do the same, although I've already said too much.
