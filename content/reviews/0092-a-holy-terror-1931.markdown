Nonsense plot has polo-playing, New York trust-funder O’Brien flying to Wyoming to investigate his father’s murder. After crash-landing his prop-plane in Eilers’s shower, he runs up against Bogie, the foreman of the man he’s in town to see.

<!-- end -->

Forgettable in every way, save it marks Bogie’s first performance as a heavy, a role he’d struggle to escape for much of his early career.

The print on YouTube was a hybrid workprint, including title cards for fade-ins and outs, and missing several minutes. That said, I can’t imagine the missing footage turning this turkey into anything but a longer turkey.
