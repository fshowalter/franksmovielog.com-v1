Set 10-years after <span data-imdb-id="tt1870419">_Hatchet III_</span>, Crowley returns to terrorize the survivors of a plane crash. This entry regresses to the first two films' visual style, betraying its rushed production at every turn. Its meta-context regulates Crowley to a plot device versus the central focus. The result feels like an "Elseworlds" entry versus a true continuation of the franchise. Not a total burn, but disappointing.
