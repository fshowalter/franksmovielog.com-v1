Ingmar Bergman's first feature. Landgr√© plays Nelly, an 18-year-old girl raised by piano-teacher Lind in a small village. Nelly--who yearns for something more--sees an escape when her estranged mother arrives to claim her. But happiness eludes Nelly in the big city, where a complex triangle forms between her, her mother, and her mother's gigolo boyfriend.

A modest but engrossing debut from Bergman, whose formal technique takes a back-seat to his casts' performances. I appreciated the film's organic plotting. The lack of Hays-Code morality stands in stark contrast to contemporary Hollywood offerings, which feel artificial in comparison. It's not a great film, but a solid debut.

Confession: the day-for-night shots struck me as lazy until I realized Sweden has 18-hour summer days.
