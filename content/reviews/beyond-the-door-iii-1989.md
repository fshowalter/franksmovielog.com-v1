Not a <span data-imdb-id="">_Beyond the Door_</span> sequel, but an original film re-titled. Mary Kohnert plays Beverly, a timid teen traveling to Yugoslavia on a class trip. Bo Svenson channels Sean Bean as the sinister professor Andromolek, who meets the students when they arrive. Andromolek takes them to a remote village where he intends for Beverly to star in a once-a-century satanic ritual.

A straightforward trap premise, but the kids prove smart and flee at the first sign of trouble. I won't spoil any more. Suffice it to say the atmospheric location photography and surprising production values overcome the kids' stiff acting. The resulting rollercoaster careens between schlock and inspired dread--sometimes in the same scene. 

And that shot toward the end, of the carriage traveling in front of a lake at dusk, would make Terrence Malick proud.
