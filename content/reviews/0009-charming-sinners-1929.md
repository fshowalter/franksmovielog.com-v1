I watched a low-res encoding of a scratchy print replete with frame and audio drop-outs on a Russian social networking site. Beggars can't be choosers.

The title proves misleading. The sinners in question prove far from charming. Instead, Ruth Chatterton steals the film with a charismatic turn as a kept wife whose husband is conducting a not-so-discreet affair with her best friend. William Powell plays her former flame returned to town.

Watching Powell, it's fascinating to see him grow as an actor. In just his second talkie, he's already recognizing the importance of _reacting_ during his dialog exchanges.

But this is Chatterton's movie. Bonus points to the script for affording her real agency and even more bonus points to Chatterton herself for out-charming Powell and overcoming the disappointing ending.
