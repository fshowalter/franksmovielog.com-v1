Found a low-res encoding of a scratchy print complete with frame and audio drop-outs uploaded a Russian social networking site. Beggers can't be choosers and I'm glad I saw this one. It's a stiff melodrama with a misleading title--the sinners in question are the least charming characters. Instead, Ruth Chatterton steals the film with a charismatic turn as a kept wife whose husband is having a not-so-discreet affair with her best friend. Powell plays Chatterton's former flame returned to town.

Watching Powell, it's fascinating seeing him grow as an actor. In just his second talkie, he's already recognizing the importance of _reacting_ during his dialog exchanges, as evidenced by his first scene with Chatterton where his innate charm is elevated even more by his facial responses to Chatterton's actions.

But this is Chatterton's movie. Bonus points for the script giving her character real agency and even more bonus points to Chatteron for out charming Powell. It even overcomes the disappinting ending.
