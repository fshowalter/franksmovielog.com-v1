I found a low-res encoding of a scratchy print replete with frame and audio drop-outs on a Russian social networking site. Beggers can't be choosers.

The title proves misleading. The sinners in question are the least charming characters. Instead, Ruth Chatterton steals the film with a charismatic turn as a kept wife whose husband is having a not-so-discreet affair with her best friend. William Powell plays her former flame returned to town.

Watching Powell, it's fascinating seeing him grow as an actor. In just his second talkie, he's already recognizing the importance of _reacting_ during his dialog exchanges. He wins us over in his first scene with Chatterton in large part through his facial responses to Chatterton's actions.

But this is Chatterton's movie. Bonus points for the script giving her real agency and even more bonus points to her for out charming Powell and overcoming the disappinting ending.
