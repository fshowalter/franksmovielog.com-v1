This sequel to *Sherlock Holmes (2009)* sees Holmes and Watson zig-zagging across Europe in an attempt to prevent a global war orchestrated by the nefarious Professor Moriarty. More James Bond spy adventure than detective mystery, this installment, like the first, works best when Downey and Law play off each other. Director Ritchie strings the various set pieces together with flourish, making for an entertaining, but forgettable experience.
