A romantic comedy starring Gloria Swanson as a prima donna facing a career ceiling because of her passionless performances. She falls for a handsome stranger played by Melvyn Douglas, but an idiot plot causes her to believe him a gigolo. Putting aside the plot's overt sexism, I struggled with Swanson's petulant, egomaniacal character. What does Douglas's character see in her? Boris Karloff appears in a single scene as a hotel waiter.
