Daniel Craig places a disgraced journalist who partners with an anti-social hacker played by Rooney Mara to investigate a forty-year-old disappearance and probable murder. As the pair dig deeper, they find their lives in jeopardy.

Disappointing remake, more so because it starts so well, with a James Bond-esque credit sequence followed by location photography so perfect you'd think director David Fincher hand placed every snowflake.

This should have been Fincher's giallo, and he does craft some
suspenseful scenes, but the Hollywood casting spotlights the killer's identity, so we spend the next two hours hoping for a Keyser SÃ¶ze twist that never comes. Watch <span data-imdb-id="tt1132620">the 2009 version</span> instead.
