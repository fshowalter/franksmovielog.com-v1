**Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond debut.** Loved it back in '95. On revisiting, it still entertains. The mix of action and light humor harkens back to Roger Moore’s better installments. Director Martin Campbell may prove more journeyman than auteur, but he delivers an entertaining product. Followed by <span data-imdb-id="tt0120347">_Tomorrow Never Dies_</span>.
