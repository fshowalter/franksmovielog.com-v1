A portmanteau comprising the stories of three married women awaiting their husbands at a summer cottage.

The vignettes play out with confidence and ring true, but lack resonance. Honest performances all around, but the women's deepest secrets all revolve around disappointments in their respective husbands. Shocking for a 1950s audience, but trite today.
