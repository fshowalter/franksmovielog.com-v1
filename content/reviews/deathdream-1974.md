Andy, a young Vietnam draftee believed killed-in-action, returns home to grateful parents in a small Florida town. Though he appears fine on the outside, Andy is... different. Detached, icy, unfeeling and possessed with a terrible desire to kill.

Director Bob Clark delivers an insightful allegory to the post-Vietnam experience. Writer Alan Ormsby's script envisions Andy as a literal walking corpse. Dead inside and exhibiting the symptoms of post-traumatic-stress disorder and drug addiction cranked to monstrous levels. Clark grounds the proceedings in a relatable small-town atmosphere Stephen King would admire.

The cast shines. I loved Richard Backus as Andy. His performance manages to be both chilling and compelling. No small feat. I also loved Henderson Forsythe as the town doctor. There's a cracker-jack scene between him and Backus where Forsythe begins to suspect Andy's murderous nature that reminded me of the classic Van Helsing/Dracula scene.

Clark's other 1974 release, <span data-imdb-id="tt0071222">_Black Christmas_</span>, gets all the love, but at first blush _Deathdream_ proves more satisfying. Time will tell, but repeat viewings may push this to five stars.
