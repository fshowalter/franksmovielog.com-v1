A superior sequel to <span data-imdb-id="tt9580138">_Scorpion's Revenge_</span> that eschews overwrought plot in favor of a simple story comprising one long tournament interspersed with ninja fights and some great quips from Joel McHale. Bonus points for all the callbacks to the gamesâ€™ special moves. Proof less can be more.
