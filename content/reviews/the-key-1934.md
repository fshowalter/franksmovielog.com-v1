In 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, William Powell plays a Canadian expat serving in the British Army. He arrives in Dublin with a history of womanizing scandals smoothed over by battlefield heroics. To his surprise, he discovers his assigned apartment sits one floor below an old flame played by Edna Best. She's now married to an old friend of Powell's, an intelligence officer played by Colin Clive. Powell spends his days pursuing an Irish fugitive in the titular Key, a section of Dublin riddled with snipers and ambush spots. Clive relieves him at night when Powell pursues Best.

This film reunites Powell with his <span data-imdb-id="tt0024471">_Private Detective 62_</span> director, Michael Curtiz, who struggles to inject vigor into the proceedings. He depicts a tense basement showdown via wall-cast shadows, rendering the players larger-than-life. He also inserts a nice whip pan to enliven the script's dead air after Clive discovers Powell and Best's affair. However, Curtiz can't overcome the talky script overflowing with exposition.

The cast struggles too. At middle-age, Powell feels miscast as a womanizing daredevil whose arc sees him mature into adulthood. Saddled with petulant outbursts, Clive's theatrical performance skews toward his famous turn in <span data-imdb-id="tt0021884">_Frankenstein_</span>, undermining our sympathy for his character. And Best lacks both the chemistry with her leads and the innate charisma to overcome her underwritten part and show us what Clive and Powell see in her.

The result underwhelms. _The Key_ seems unsure of its identity. Depending on your preference, it's a noble romance ruined by silly intrigue or a taut thriller torpedoed by a tepid love story. Even the thriller angle feels watered down in the film's efforts to avoid picking a side. In trying to please every audience, it ends up pleasing no one.
