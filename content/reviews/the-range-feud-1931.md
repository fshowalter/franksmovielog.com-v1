John Wayne and Susan Fleming play lovers caught between two feuding ranchers. Lead Buck Jones plays the horseshoe-bedazzled-shirt-wearing sheriff determined to prove Wayne innocent of murder. Spoiler, there's a third party at play.

Wayne's fine but this is Jones's movie, and he does a serviceable job as a square-jawed lawman. But even at sixty-four minutes this felt overlong, with lots of filler and establishing shots.
