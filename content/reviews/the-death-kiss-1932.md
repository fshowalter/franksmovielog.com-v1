The Death Kiss reunites three of Dracula's principals, with X playing a screenwriter investigating an on-set murder after his actress girlfriend finds herself under suspicion. Edward Van Sloan plays a director, and Bela Lugosi a studio manager.

It starts awful, but this proves deliberate. After a scene featuring stilted dialog leaden with exposition, we witness an overwrought death scene. 

Then, off-screen, Van Sloan calls "Cut!" and the camera pans over to reveal the set's artifice and the studio crew. Sloan orders another take. The crew resets, spouting professional jargon. "When we do it again, silk number ten," says one crew member. "Up high, ninety-nine!" shouts another. It's capped off with Sloan directing the dying man, "When you die this time, let's have less gymnastics--and don't spin like a top when you fall."

Then a scream as a crew member discovers the actor isn't playing dead, and we get a dynamic tracking shot as Van Sloan crosses the panicked set to phone Lugosi.

It all promises a better movie than the one that follows. There should be a name for movies like this. Not a "bait-and-switch" as much as "false hope."

You see, despite this opening scene's condescension to B-movie theatrics, the film wallows in them. 

X soon arrives, sporting an Errol Flynn-like swagger that's miles away from his stiff turn in Dracula. Decked out in trench coat and hat, je plays amateur sleuth. He's smarter than the cops because the script paints the cops as idiots who miss basic clues like bullets in walls. 

When William Powell does this in the X movies, he's charming, but X overdoes it, coming across as arrogant as he pick-pockets detectives, and uttering ridiculous lines like, “You know as well as I do that the scribblings a man makes on a piece of paper are as identifying as his signature”

Lugosi, just x years after Dracula, disappoints in  his supporting role. He delivers his dialogue with mechanical inflection, as though reciting it phonetically, in a part that exists only to proffer another suspect. 

For fans of Dracula, this may prove an interesting curio. A one-time watch that offering a surprising performance from X. But said performance's novelty wears off fast, leaving you with an inane whodunit where the villain proves the most charming.
