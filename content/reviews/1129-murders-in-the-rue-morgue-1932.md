In 1845 Paris, Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist injecting blood from his sideshow ape into abducted women to prove an ape-to-human evolutionary link. Cooky set design and stylish cinematography can’t overcome the talky script (with dialog punch-ups by John Huston!) and ape suit effects that aren’t fooling anyone. The scariest thing about this movie is Lugosi’s unibrow.
