Opens strong, with great location photography featuring a pair of wolves running through a snowy forest. Then a jarring cut to an obvious soundstage resets our expectations.

The story bears no resemblance to the Jack London novel. Franco Nero plays a journalist who arrives in the Yukon to investigate a mining town and its de facto ruler, played by John Steiner. I enjoyed this part. Nero and his buddy prove general bad-asses by hammering nails with their palms, ripping signs off walls, and beating the daylights out of Steiner's goons.

But the titular White Fang part of the story proved a mixed bag. He's a wolf-dog mix, who threads through the story like Lassie. Pulling a kid from a frozen lake and barking for help, jumping through windows when he's trapped in a building, and--my favorite--teleporting from a tiger trap to Nero's bedroom to stop a would-be assassin. It's a silly distraction that mars an otherwise entertaining western.

Or does it? I'm not sure of the intended audience. Given the dog's presence, I expected a kid-friendly adventure film, but the graphic violence points to an older target audience. But what did the producers expect when they hired Lucio Fulci to direct?

Regardless, _White Fang_ isn't an awful film. Nero's entertaining and Steiner relishes his cartoonishly evil role. Good fun, but too uneven.
