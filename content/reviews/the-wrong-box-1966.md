In Victorian England, two elderly brothers strive to outlive (and murder) each other in order to inherit a fortune. The apt blend of black comedy and farce may require a second viewing really appreciate, but the strong cast, good production and a laugh-out-loud-funny turn by Peter Sellers shouldn't make that too much of a chore.
