A standard home invasion premise. In a secluded country estate, a couple finds themselves terrorized by unknown assailants. This entry favors suspense over explicit violence and gore. The sprawling estate packs ample creaky floors, shadowy attics, and ominous staircases. I loved the atmosphere, but the protagonists' lack of agency proved trying despite the brief running time, and the epilogue robbed the film of any resonance.
