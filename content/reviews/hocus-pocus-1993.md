On Halloween night in Salem, Massachusetts, a transplanted L.A. teen inadvertently resurrects three witches, played by Midler, Parker, and Najimy. With a single night to live, they attempt to steal the town's children's life to extend their existence.

Kudos to the Salem location photography, but this mess of a movie reeks of studio notes. The teen protagonist and incessant virgin references point to a darker tone and older target audience. The tag-along kid-sister and stagy presentation skew toward traditional G-rated Disney adventure fare. And nobody's reigning in Midler, who's delivering full-on camp. Everyone's making a different movie and they all disappoint.
