During a late-night make-out session with his girlfriend, a suburban teen spies two men carrying a coffin into the neighboring basement. Intrigued, he stakes out the nightly goings-on next-door, only to discover that his suave new neighbor--played by Chris Sarandon--has fangs. Desperate for help, he turns to the local creature-feature host, a washed-up horror star played by Roddy McDowall.

I love this movie. It’s a contemporary love-letter to classic vampire films buoyed by career performances from Sarandon and McDowall.

McDowall channels Peter Cushing with aplomb, hamming it up in the movie-within-a-movie early on, and dialing it back in the second half.

Opposite McDowall, Sarandon crafts a villain for the ages. Bucking the faceless killer trend, Sarandon is all sociopathic charm and ice-cold calculation. “Welcome to Fright Night....for real,” indeed.
