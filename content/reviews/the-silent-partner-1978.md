Imagine you’re a bank teller and discover someone is planning to hold-up your branch. Would you tell the police? Would you call in sick? Or would you do as Elliott Gould’s character in _The Silent Partner_ does and steal the money yourself? The gunman escapes with a pittance, you report the full amount as stolen and pocket the difference. A great plan, but what if the gunman knows you’ve done it and wants the money?

That’s the setup and the film doesn’t squander it. The plot layers double-cross atop double-cross--some predictable, others not--but never feels forced or outlandish. It respects our intelligence.

The cast shines too. Christopher Plummer chills as the psychotic, mascara-clad thief. Gould’s towering stature and confident swagger make him less-than-perfect for his part (Dustin Hoffman would have been ideal) but his innate charisma compensates.

My lone complaint lies with the dialogue, which doesn't crackle like it should for a film this twisty. It's not a deal-breaker, but I’d love to see a remake scripted by David Mamet.
