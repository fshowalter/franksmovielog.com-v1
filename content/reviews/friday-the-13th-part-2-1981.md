Still no hockey mask, but we have Jason (sporting a burlap sack over his face) stalking a group of camp counselors.

This entry has grown on me. I originally preferred the <span data-imdb-id="tt0080761">first film</span>’s dingy atmosphere and documentary style, but I’ve come around to this sequel’s superior execution. The supporting cast proves more memorable, and the script provides the final-girl with real agency.
