**My favorite gambling movie.** George Segal and Elliott Gould amble through card rooms, tracks, and bars, culminating in a high-stakes Reno poker game. Director Robert Altman's cynical—yet often humorous—portrait conveys a visceral sense of Segal and Gould's swings. Short on plot but long on atmosphere, it's the closest thing to being there.
