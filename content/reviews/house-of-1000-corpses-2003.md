**Rob Zombie's directorial debut.** In the late 70s, four road-tripping college-age kids visit "Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters & Madmen." Sid Haig plays Spaulding as a combination carnival barker and clown, with a memorable mix of crass humor and menace. When the kids inquire about the local legend of Dr. Satan, Spaulding directs them to a local house where they encounter an all-too-real demented family.

Zombie's aesthetic mixes 70s grindhouse exploitation with late-90s MTV. I enjoyed the grindhouse influences. A funeral procession shot evokes Italian and Spanish horror. The demented family echoes Tobe Hooper's <span data-imdb-id="tt0072271">_The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_</span>.

Indeed, Chainsaw and <span data-imdb-id="tt0092076">its sequel</span> prove the biggest influences, with Zombie's film landing somewhere between the pair in terms of tone. Also like _Chainsaw_, the film proves nowhere near as gory as its lurid title would imply.

Perhaps I'm being too apologetic. I could have done without the MTV influences. The interstitial 16mm sequences proffer a music video aesthetic that lends an amateurish feel. And the kids—the women in particular—felt interchangeable.

But I'm inclined to forgive when a film shares my tastes. _House of 1,000 Corpses_ isn't perfect, but I enjoyed the throwback sensibilities and Zombie's clear fondness for the genre.
