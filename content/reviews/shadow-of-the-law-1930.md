Powell plays an innocent man sent to prison for murder. He escapes and establishes a new life. Hoping to clear his name, he locates the woman whose testimony could exonerate him, only to have her blackmail him.

An efficient script, innovative camera-work, and gripping performances from Powell and Natalie Moorhead make this a standout among Powell’s early sound work. I’d love to see a proper HD release. Powell gets his trademark mustache shaved when he enters prison, and--even at VHS quality--it proved jarring.
