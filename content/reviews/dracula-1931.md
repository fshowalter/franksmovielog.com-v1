I first saw _Dracula_ on TV. I don't remember when, but I was still fishing prizes out of breakfast cereals and watching Saturday morning cartoons. I do remember loving the movie. Toys, costumes, books, and a lifelong interest followed. In the decades since, I've seen the film dozens of times.

Yet, it wasn't until this viewing that I realized the film leaves the Lucy plot-thread unresolved. Embarrassing, but true.
