Commentary rewatch. Lee Gambin, an unabashed fan of both Friedkin and Sonny and Cher, offers a wealth of information about the film's production and stars. But he did little to convince me of the film's merits. At best, I gained an appreciation for Friedkin's dynamic camera work. But I still struggled with Bono's uncanny valley performance. He's a thirty-something man acting like a teenager. It's not so much that it's a bad performance (it is) but how calculated it feels, right down to portraying him as a henpecked husband with Cher not letting him ride his motorcycle.

The supplemental interview with Friedkin from 2018 proved more enlightening. Friedkin reveals he passed on directing second unit in John Frankenheimer's <span data-imdb-id="tt0060472">_Grand Prix_</span> to make this film. He also makes clear how Bono was the driving creative force. Looking back, he regrets the film's vigorous rehearsals, though admits Sonny and Cher required them. Maybe he's reacting to the same artifice in Bono's performance.
