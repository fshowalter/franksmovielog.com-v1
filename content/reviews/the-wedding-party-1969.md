Despite featuring an early performance from a young Robert De Niro, director Brian De Palma proves the star of his first filmed picture. He employs an array of formal devices to tell a farcical story of a groom-to-be’s second thoughts after encountering his fiancée's eccentric family. De Niro plays a groomsman.

It’s an interesting watch, but only somewhat amusing. De Palma presents several sequences like silent comedy. A smart move given the limited budget and novice cast, but style can only gloss over so much.
