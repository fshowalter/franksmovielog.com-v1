**Clive Barker's screenwriting debut.** Larry Lamb plays Roy Bain, a retired enforcer recruited by a mob boss, to find a missing high-class prostitute. His investigation uncovers a group of mutants living in the London Underground.

Aside from some snappy early dialog when a pair of hoods come to collect Bain, and the thematic similarities to Barker's later <span data-imdb-id="tt0100260">_Nightbreed_</span>, the film has little to recommend it. Steven Berkoff delivers the lone credible performance as the mob boss who brings in Bain. Top-billed Denholm Elliott plays the mad scientist responsible for the mutants. Said mutants are addicts hooked on Elliott's mind-expanding drug. Lamb shows flashes of charisma, but I struggled with the costumer's decision to tuck his pants into a pair of cavalier boots. The finale devolves into an uzi-fueled shoot-â€˜em-up more preposterous than the mutants.

The print streaming on Amazon is high definition but cropped aside from the pan-and-scan credits.
