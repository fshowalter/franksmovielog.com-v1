Everything I missed in the _Star Wars_ revival. A cogent, epic story, memorable characters, and an immersive world.

But it's incomplete. The innumerable slow-motion shots of Zendaya turning to squint-gaze over her shoulder never pay off. We're offered no sense of the populous ruled by the various houses. And the abrupt ending underwhelms. Still, I'm convinced director Denis Villeneuve knows what he's doing and where he's going. Bring on part two.
