It's best to go in blind. I knew the two planned to kill one another, but the film expects half of this equation to surprise us.

It aims for <span data-imdb-id="tt0119167">_Funny Games_</span> by way of Quentin Tarantino. Great idea. But director/co-writer Tommy Wirkola's strength lies in frantic—borderline cartoonish—action that thrills and amuses.

This film proffers multiple scenes where one party restrains another, then engages in a drawn-out exchange. The dialogue isn't awful, but it's not Tarantino-level witty either.

Rapace and Hennie give their all. Their innate charisma goes a long way toward holding our interest. Hennie, in particular, makes his horrible character compelling, no small feat.

When the finale arrives, Wirkola shines. We get genuine surprises and a refreshing sense of chaos. But it proves too little too late. This isn't a poor film so much as an overlong and overextended one. It's two-hours instead of a tight ninety.
