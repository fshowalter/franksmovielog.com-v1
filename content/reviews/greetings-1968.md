**Robert De Niro's first credited feature.** He plays one of three New York City twenty-somethings navigating the Vietnam War draft, computer-dating, and JFK conspiracy theories. De Palma structures the film as a series of vignettes, each with its own title card.

I loved the guerilla-style New York City photography. And I appreciated the natural performances and De Palma's plain presentation. But I struggled to connect with the film's humor. It talks in shorthand to a 1968 audience, and I lack the social context and awareness to appreciate the nuance.
