Disappointing sequel sees perennial doofuses Bill and Ted still struggling to fulfill their destiny while facing crumbling marriages and their college-age children’s expectations. I wanted to like this more. The script strives to recapture the <span data-imdb-id="tt0096928">first entry</span>’s sense of whimsy by recreating the original film while telling a new story, but the result feels too self-conscious. The cast commits but can’t overcome the material. Ted wearing a button-up and slacks proves you can’t go home again.
