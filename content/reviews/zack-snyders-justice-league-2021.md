Much improved. The tone proves more consistent throughout, and including big-bad Darkseid ups the narrative stakes, while the expanded backstories supply more robust emotional stakes.

The four-hour running time feels right for the story, but screenwriter Chris Terrio's structure feels more suited to a television series. Alongside <span data-imdb-id="tt2975590">_Batman v Superman_</span>, this production hints at a broader, more epic storyline including a Darkseid-controlled Superman and a final reckoning between Batman and Joker. Releasing multiple four-hour films was never going to happen, but multiple seasons of a _Justice League_ series could have set HBO up with a post-_Game of Thrones_ franchise.

This new version isn't perfect. Ezra Miller and Jesse Eisenberg still feel miscast--though the latter has almost no screen time. And the finale's murky visual effects fail to evoke an appropriate sense of awe.

But I enjoyed this passion project more than I expected. If nothing else, it's the best Green Lantern movie we've gotten to date.
