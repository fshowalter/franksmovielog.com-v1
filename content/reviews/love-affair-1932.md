Dorothy Mackaill plays a wealthy heiress who falls for an aviation engineer played by Humphrey Bogart. He's developed a revolutionary new airplane engine but neglects his struggling company to romance her.

In a bit of pre-code reality, they spend the night together. He proposes the next morning but--almost broke and realizing she's dragging him down--she says no. He throws himself into his work and--well, you can see where this is going.

Bogart's sister and Mackaill's would-be suitor are also an item that—in a refreshing surprise—wraps up without devolving into an idiot plot. Bogart acquits himself well in a good part, but Mackaill carries the movie with her considerable charisma.
