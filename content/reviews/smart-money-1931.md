**<span data-imdb-id="tt0021079">_Little Caesar_</span> lite.** Robinson plays a small-time gambler (instead of a gangster) who claws his way atop the big city game, only for a woman to prove his undoing. Cagney plays his longtime friend and heavy. I liked the gambling scenes, and Robinson and Cagney's chemistry, but the lower narrative stakes render this less resonant than the pair's more iconic films. Boris Karloff makes a forgettable appearance as a pimp in an early dice game.
