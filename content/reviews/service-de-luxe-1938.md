**Vincent Price's debut.** He plays a henpecked inventor hoping to sell his plan for a new tractor. Constance Bennett plays the owner of a company of female concierges who manage wealthy men's lives. She longs for an independent man. He longs for a submissive woman. You can see where it's going.

Bennett charmed me from her first scene and never let go. Though the script has her yearning for a sexist norm, she never loses her agency. Price acquits himself well in a role I could imagine John Wayne playing. And the script even pokes fun at its own convenient plotting. This one surprised me.
