I liked this one, but I wanted to love it. Based on H.P. Lovecraft's story, the plot sees a family doomed by extraterrestrial forces after a meteorite lands in the front yard of their isolated New England farm house. Nicholas Cage plays the exasperated patriarch.

I loved the atmosphere. The opening wide shots convey a clarity of vision in the storytelling with director Richard Stanley establishing the environment as a central character. This proves the story's highlght as the natural green and grey forest transforms to an unnatrual psychadelic purple. 

The cast shines too. I bought everyone in their roles, though Cage's performance feels to heightened at the start. 

Which brings me to my lone gripe. I sense there's a great movie here. Perhaps a longer cut affording Cage more runway to transform from mild Dad to deranged victim. Or a shorter cut fueled by nightmare logic. As-is, the film feels disjointed. Cage's relationship with his father emerges in two isloated scenes as though it were a central theme. The lame explanation for the ever-present alpacas makes no sense and doesn't pay-off. Its as though Stanley couldn't decide if he wanted to present a dramatic horror or psychadellic nightmare and tried for both. He delivers great aspects of both, but by committing to neither, shortchanges his film.
