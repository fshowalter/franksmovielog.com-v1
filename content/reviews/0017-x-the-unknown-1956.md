I'm calling this the start of the Hammer Horror era, as it's Jimmy Sangster's first screenplay. Dean Jagger plays a scientist battling a radioactive blob spewed forth from the earth's core. Unlike the other blob movie, this one plays more grown-up, exploiting the atomic-age fears of the era. Engaging performances and gruesome makeup effects offset the budget-constrained miniature work.
