I'm calling this the start of the Hammer Horror era, as it's Jimmy Sangster's first screenplay. Dean Jagger plays a scientist battling a radioactive blob spewed forth from the earth's core. Unlike <dpan data-imdb-id="tt0051418">the other blob movie</span> (that came two years later), this one plays more grown-up, exploiting the atomic-age fears of the era. Engaging performances and gruesome makeup effects offset the budget-constrained miniature work. Love the pervasive hints of cold, from the ice in the mud to the foggy puffs of breath in every outdoor shot.
