If <span data-imdb-id="tt0049646">The Quatermass Xperiment</a> marked Hammer Horror's conception, this marks its birth. Dean Jagger plays a scientist battling a radioactive blob spewed forth from the earth's core. Unlike <span data-imdb-id="tt0051418">the other blob movie</span> (that came two years later), Jimmy Sangster's screenplay--his first produced--plays more grown-up, remixing the Quatermass essence into an efficient thriller exploiting the era's atomic-age fears. <span data-snippet>Engaging performances and gruesome makeup effects offset the budget-constrained miniature work.</span> Love the pervasive hints of cold, from the ice in the mud to the foggy puffs of breath in every outdoor shot. The Scream Factory print looks great, though not as good as the Kino Lorber Quatermass.
