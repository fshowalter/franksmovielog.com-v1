**William Friedkin's debut feature.** A post-<span data-imdb-id="tt0058182">_Hard Day's Night_ pop musical that sees Sonny and Cher spoof the western, _Tarzan_, and hard-boiled detective genres.

<!-- end -->

The tone and production style evoke the then-contemporary _Batman_ television series--complete with George Sanders as the celebrity villain.

The hard-boiled segment elicited a few chuckles, but the rest falls flat. Sonny gets more lines and screen time than Cher, to the film's detriment. Something about his performance gnawed at me. I couldn't shake the sense that he was "playing" Sonny. Maybe it was the dissonance of his age and his haircut, or maybe it was the contrast with Cher's apparent ease, but regardless, he lacked the charisma to carry the picture.

Add a star if you're an ardent fan of their music.
