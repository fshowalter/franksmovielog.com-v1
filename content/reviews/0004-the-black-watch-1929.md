Godawful dialog scenes torpedo John Ford's first talkie. Myrna Loy--carrying over her (miss)casting from silents as an exotic vamp--gets the worst of it, enduring lines full of "thees" and "thous" delivered with her eyes half closed. I don't blame Ford, the studio insisted the dialog scenes be "staged by" Lumsden Hare, a dialog director. Said Ford[^Peter Bogdanovich. *John Ford* (United Kingdom: Studio Vista, 1967), 50.]:

> That was another picture they changed after I'd gone. Winfield Sheehan was in charge of production then, and he said there weren't enough love scenes in it. He thought Lumsden Hare was a great British actor--he wasn't, but he impressed Sheehan--so he got Hare to direct some love scenes between McLaglen and Myrna Loy. And they were really horrible--long, talky things, had nothing to do with the story--and completely screwed it up. I wanted to vomit when I saw them.
