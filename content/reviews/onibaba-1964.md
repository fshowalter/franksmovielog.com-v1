This review proves a challenge. I appreciate what _Onibaba_ is about, and the formal rigor director Kaneto Shindô employed, but the film didn't work for me.

<!-- end -->

Set during the Warring States era, the film presents an almost post-apocalyptic Japan trampled by constant civil war. The opening scene introduces us to an old woman and her daughter-in-law, who survive by murdering stray soldiers unfortunate enough to wander into the endless tall grass surrounding their dismal hut. It's a miserable existence.

Enter a man, their former neighbor, who has fled the army. Soon, the daughter-in-law is sneaking out to have sex with him. Wise to the situation, the old woman fears her daughter-in-law will abandon her. Alone, the old woman believes she won't be able to kill and will starve.

Enter a mysterious samurai wearing a kabuki mask. The old woman--well, I won't spoil it. Suffice it to say, the film veers into horror, but without the usual puritanical overtones.

I respected the film's craft, but I didn't buy what it was selling. The gothic cinematography and inventive sound design create an illusion of depth, but the film proves shallow. Shindô casts his characters in a sub-human existence to better explore their primal natures, but this feels reductive. It's no great stretch to illustrate humanity's baser urges when you've already reduced them to animals.
