Lesser-known Hitchcock entry sees a sedate married couple gifted an unexpected windfall. They tour the world but find romance with others along the way. It's a tired tropeâ€”give the lower class money and they'll find misery. Hitchcock seems less interested in the story than in the formal devices he can employ to tell it. The opening plays like a silent film, and the trend continues throughout with title cards and broad performances. Much of the comedy falls flat, save a third act gag involving the couple devouring a much-needed meal before discovering its origins. Chalk this up as a failed experiment best forgotten.
