Starts strong, with Corey Allen and Warren Oates as a pair of disturbed drifters who sight frustrated housewife Kate Manx at a Los Angeles filling station and trail her to her home in the hills. There Allen poses as a landscaper and hits on Manx. Then nothing much happens for an hour. We're given seventy minutes of setup against ten minutes of payoff. After opening the film dripping with impulsive menace, the long-game con Allen works on Manx feels incongruous. Strong performances all around, but this plays like a short stretched to feature length.
