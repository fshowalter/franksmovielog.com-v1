**Pam Grier's feature debut.** It's a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance and, I admit, I missed it. But I'm eager to re-watch this with commentary by screenwriter Roger Ebert.

Satirizing <span data-imdb-id="tt0062430">_Valley of the Dolls_</span>, the story plays as an over-the-top cautionary fable. We follow an all-girl rock-and-roll trio and their manager, who head to Los Angeles. There, they succumb to fame, sex, drugs, and murder. Credit director Russ Meyer for walking a tonal tightrope between detached camp and earnest embarrassment. The result proves ridiculous yet compelling. John Lazar's performance as a charismatic, Shakespear-quoting music mogul stands out.

I also appreciated the film’s decision to treat the violence with the same measured tone. It’s bloody and gruesome, yet somehow not mean-spirited or off-putting. Most of all, I appreciated the film’s willingness to eviscerate both sides of the generation gap. A critical reveal proves timely, demonstrating how the “enlightened” flower children weren’t ready to accept all types of people.
