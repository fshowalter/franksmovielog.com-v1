Source for www.franksmovielog.com. Built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Setup

1.  **Install nvm.**

    See [the instructions at the NVM repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

1.  **Intialize your Node env.**

    An .nvmrc is included in the project.

    ```shell
    # use the .nvmrc version of Node.
    nvm use
    ```

1.  **Install yarn.**

    Yarn is our package-manger of choice.

    ```shell
    # install yarn via Homebrew
    brew install yarn
    ```

1.  **Start a Dev server.**

    Running the task through yarn will also pass the necessary parameters to
    allow external access to the site.

    ```shell
    # start Gatsby develop.
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000` with a GraphQL instance at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.
